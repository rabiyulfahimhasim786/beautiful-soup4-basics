      "Where do you want to go, Miss? Are you going to Hannover? With you? Of course. - Get in. - Sure. But my friend must also come. Dear God, another one? Okay, get in, both of you. This'll be a comfortable ride, no? With this heat we could use some refreshment, no? Cigarette? Give your friend one too, so she doesn't get grumpy. No, she's dead tired, she'll sleep. I like taking people along. - One can share the fuel costs... - But I have no money. Who says money? With a body like that... Just seeing these damn motorbikes... The scum of earth. You get nervous? - Well, them? - Yeah, very much. I'll try to shake them off. We can't get rid of them! Finally. Some peace and quiet now. Get out now! Don't resist or I'll kick your ass - shut up! Not so clever now, huh? Wallet now! Want me to help you?! Will you... Can I drive on now? Be happy, you'll lose a few kilos walking! Had your little adventure now? Quick, I was robbed! Money, car - all gone! - You can still get them! - Get into the car then. Turn off the motor. Why, what's up? Should've given way, you know? Yeah, well, it's night... - Who cares, sarge? - Show me your license. Please. Here's a ticket, 3 mark, so that you'll learn from this. You'd rather be charged? I'll just pay, if I can. Did a grey Kapitän just pass? Was that a Kapitän before? Didn't see, why? It was involved in a robbery. 10 minutes ago, near kilometer 13. One woman and three men. Two of them on motorbikes. What about him? Traffic violation. Didn't you come from AVUS too? Yeah, from Wannsee. Didn't you tail that car with the other bike? Didn't notice, I'm alone. Was he with them? Do you recognize him? Can't say, gentlemen. It's possible, sure. I don't know, I was blinded. Follow us, young man. We'll investigate this case. Dude, make-up all over your face. You still owe me 1.60 from yesterday. I'm telling you, he's not here. Don't know if or when he'll come. Still missing a penny. - Do you know where he is, I need to, I need to... - No! - Tell him, I need him. - Yes, fine, I'll do it. - I need him... - I'll tell him if he ever comes back! Thank you so much, thank you! Thanks. - Hey, 6 cognacs is 9.90! - It's fine, put it on the tap. Thanks, thanks... Get me another double, same bill. So, how was it? - Exciting? - It's all routine, professor. Maybe I'll join one, soon? You're still green behind the ears, boy. Our newcomer. Doing well, isn't he? Werner's coming. At last. Hope that's it for today. I'm beat too. Working all day, out all night. - Well? - Still need us tonight? No, we'll call it a day. - I'm good with that. - Okay, that's done. Nice gathering, inconspicuous too. Go, drink's on me, professor. - Where's Rob? - Caught. Traffic police. Once again, this idiot. - Hope he won't talk. - No, he's solid. Oh, pretty good. 220? No, Opel Kapitän. Where'd you leave it? Side street, Halensee. - See you tomorrow. - See you. The old man's been here. - Needs something again? - Always, or he wouldn't come. I've got to visit him. - You don't need to. - What I need is my business. If Rob should come, tell him to wait for me. All good, professor? Go and get some sleep then. Tomorrow you're up. Bye. - The old man still owes me. - Yeah, so I've guessed. - Is that enough? - Yes, it's enough. ... for me too. Robert Hahn, 07.08.1937, Berlin. Skilled worker, parents deceased. Current address: \"Kolonie Siedlerglück\" Huh? All good, thanks. See, detective? It's all in order. - Think I'm lying, when the police knows everything? - Shut up! On the AVUS, at night? Just driving around a bit? - Huh, you can tell your granny. - She's dead. - Don't be cheeky. So... where were you? Well, I've told you. I've had the cylinder head and pistons done. One had to take it out for a ride. - At night, on the AVUS? - Well, I'm working at daytime. Mr. Römer? The Kapitän's been found, Halensee. - Even the key's inside. - Is that so? Well at least the car's there. See, all good now. I've told you not to speak unless asked. Sure, won't say another word then. Yes? Sure, Schmidt, I know. But leave me alone with that press now. We're not sleeping here either. We've doubled the shifts on AVUS, the Heerstraße and Tiergarten. Why, the chief's gone upstairs? Fine, I'll come. The press is out for blood, the boss is getting nervous. He wants results, out of thin air! We must catch those thugs. So, Mr. Thiel. You process this man for now. Don't go easy on him. Don't worry about the old man. What are you riding, the 500? - No, Horex 350. - That's a nice one. - Could be more comfortable. - Nah, I wouldn't say that. One of the boys has one, you'd think it has no saddle. - You're in a little gang then? - Some colleagues and friends. - Well... - An old geezer like that won't understand that. For him it's all scum and thugs. I've shown him some new records recently. Louis Armstrong and so on, didn't fit up there with him. - You know Charlie Brown? - Charlie Brown? - Just bought it, nice piece. - Already paid off your bike? - Why? - Just asking. - A few more rates. - Nice. Listen up, kid. You see we're speaking the same language. If you're ever worried... Know the Zoo kiosk? Mhm, I know it. I eat there every day. Around 5pm, after work. I talk to the boys, about their worries. One got in deep, now he's got cold feet. Other one was nailed, you know. The way to police is still best, if it ever comes to that... Prison's a dark place. Clear? Hm, I get it. Cheers to you, doctor. You need it. Not looking so well. When I think about the man you've been. And now... You'll develop a nice paranoia, if you continue like that. It'll start with... Diffuse softenings, the decay of the cerebellum, and then it's over! It'd be a pity, doctor, no? Since you're my only patient. Now... ... next please! Next please! Next please! Good evening, father. Back at it again, huh? Do you need to drink this poison? Want to destroy yourself? What else should I do? I didn't even have a penny left. Give me some, once more. Help me one last time. Did you pay rent at least? Dear Lord, the money one spends on you. It's like a bottomless pit. So... this is rent. Allowance. And if you must drink, at least buy something normal. [slurring] I... I thank you. Nonsense, get a hold of yourself. And don't come to Splendid. Don't want to see you there, got it? Now go and sleep. Sleep... I can't sleep anymore. I walk around the flat all night. I can't sleep anymore. Sometimes I think... It's not right up here. Stay... stay here... Werner, stay... - Stay with me tonight. - No, no, no... I can't take the air here. Come, I'll take you to bed. - See, up there? - Ah, yeah! Rudi and the professor. Already off work? Maybe due to the heat. Ah, no, they've got shorter shifts. Should also be like that here. These damn 8 hour shifts. Breakfast, lunch and commute it's almost 10 hours. What's even left of the day then? I like working up here. Nice view and nice air here. For 2.38 an hour? What you earn in 2 months here, you earn with Werner in a night. - Want to be a millionaire? - Why not? I want to buy a petrol station in a few years. One with 4 pumps, get it? Then I'll be behind the register, just cashing in all day. Tell me, Fritz. Have you ever considered something going sideways? Sideways? With Werner...? Never. Why do you ask? I don't know. Got a bad feeling when they caught me yesterday. I know it's not easy, gentlemen. But the press isn't entirely wrong. 4 robberies. 2 on AVUS, 1 on Heerstraße and 1 near Tiergarten. The Klermann case... and the robbery on Odeum cinema's register. It's always cash and motorized robbers. There's connections here, it must be an organized gang. But we're still in the dark. I thought we got close yesterday. When we nailed the biker on AVUS. Why didn't you keep him? - Jailed him? - I said that too... - But Thiel let him go. - I don't understand it. - If you catch one- - You catch none. I apologize, chief. I also thought the boy was connected to the AVUS story. But we had no proof. If we had jailed him... It'd just have been a warning to them. If this is really an organized gang, well... The boys are intelligent enough to disappear. - So now we have nothing. - But we do, chief. Contact's been made. The boy's got a soft spot, he's moldy, as they say. He'll come back. Well... good luck then. Go, pick one then. Hurts, doesn't it? More than once, then definitely. Part of business, isn't it? With this rent here, ha! What do you think I'm paying here monthly? I bet, these sharks. You're a gold mine for them, no? Each penny, you hear me? Otherwise it's out of here. And now another's due. Tonight is payment time. Fortune in gambling, that's misfortune in love. Why? That's not true! Good evening. - Hello, good evening! - Rob, you're back from police now? No, just a ticket, 3 mark. Werner's pissed you didn't come last night. Why, it was a bit late. I'm not sure about Rob these days. Look who's there. Looks like a child on holidays still. Hello, Inge. Got kicked out again? - Why? - Wouldn't be here otherwise. Barbara's got no space for me. I told you that you can sleep at my place. See Rob? There's your little flirt from before. - Evening. - Evening. - Want to dance? - If you want to, sure. How premature and childish. Nice to see you again, Inge. Where have you been? Just here and there. Isn't so nice to always hear East German, no? Still live with your friend? Barbara's got a boyfriend now, and I'm just a nuisance there. Rob here? Excuse me. Can I speak to your man? Right after the dance. Now please. A few minutes. Shouldn't you go, Rob? We'll dance, come. I'll be back soon. You seem to have more time than me. Listen here, Rob. 14 days ago, at the petrol station, you- ... got caught by the night guard. Barely got out ahead. A few days later you lose your ID during the cinema heist. 3 days you're gone, fine, you have a private life... And last night that stupid business with the police. Least you could do was follow the traffic rules, no? - Could happen to anyone. - Yeah, once - once! But not when we're- Step outside with me. Come. Come, come. - Stop this at once! - Nothing for the faint-hearted. Stop now, enough. All good now? I asked if all's good? Yeah. Your turn now, professor. Nah, don't worry. - Oh, what do I have to do? - A small test of courage. Now, everyone to tonight's play. The railway depot. Everyone, I said. I'll follow in a minute. Give that to Ruth for everything the boys had. - Still coming tonight? - Could be late. - You have plans? - Yeah. Nervous? Boy, that's exciting. Listen, it's easy. You put your head on the rails, over there. Say... don't you want to do the other part? Could be good for you now. In front of them. So... the one who stays the longest, has the strongest nerves, and those we need, no? Come, get ready, the train will come in a few minutes. Lights off. Hurry, train's coming. - All good, professor? - Yeah. - Nicely done, professor. - Not bad, huh? - Can I join you now? - Sure thing, professor. So, anyone ever makes fun of the boy again... He'll have to answer to me. Now... I'll need three of you. Otto, Fritz and Rudi. I have plans for you. Basement, one hour. What's the plan? We'll go for a drink. - Splendid, victory celebration. - Sure, let's do it. - And then? - Go sleep, what else? Sleep... not tonight. - Another please. - Don't get drunk here. - Werner won't like it. - Leave him be. - Come, I'll pay it. - No, it's done, here. For us discipline is everything, there's no stepping out of line. Everyone keeps their job. It's a nice disguise, see? - Come, we'll leave. - Hey, what is it? Aren't you waiting for Otto? No, I'll go to the cinema with Rob. At this hour? Yeah, Arke's playing till midnight. Listen, during a heist, not a fart. There's only silent war with us. We're clear? A fine Persian carpet, it'd be like the Hilton! Coming to you, soon in this theater. All good, boys? No time to lose, we'll need a car. As heavy as possible, but without sticky doors. - I'm on it, it's a 10 minute job. - Okay, then with the car to... Corner Steindamm/Möllnstraße. - It's the funfair, right? - Yeah. - There we'll wait for you. So, at the funfair in 30 minutes. At the funfair. There's the action. Thousands of Berliners met for the summer festival opening. Good idea with the cinema. I wanted to leave. But where will you really sleep? - I don't know. - Well... You're always welcome at mine. I mean, no need to be scared with me. I know, Rob. Can't cut me some slack this month, Mr. Streicher? If you can't pay rent on time, then you'll have to close. That's the old man's car. Behind it is Otto's bike. Fritz is opposite. As soon as we rammed the car and cashed in the money, Fritz jumps onto Otto's, we'll take the other bike and are out of here. - Clear? - Clear. Police, what now? They'll pass. Herbert 72, arrived on scene. Maybe searching for the stolen car? This doesn't look good, let's leave. Just wait. Just keep smiling... There you go. Otto. If that patrol car doesn't leave, this was for nothing. They're already here. And now? [slurring Charlie Brown song] At last. [slurring Charlie Brown song] Not this too. See you boys... Just around the corner. Shit. What happened? - A traffic accident. - Someone call the police! - Should I stop? - Keep driving! What is it? The damn car glass. This doesn't look good. - Another 5 minutes? - What's the choice? - I'll take you to a doctor. - No... - Shut up and hold on tight! So you live down there? Yeah, the cottage. Come. It's nice here! If I had such a place, the Splendid would never see me. Why not stay then? You'll keep being out at night? I don't know what you do, but I have an idea. No, Rob. That's nothing for me. I understand, I also want to leave them behind. - Why not do it? - It's not that easy, Inge. And if I help you? Maybe. Get back! Drinking again! When one needs you once! Fine! It's all good. Towel. - Where's he? - Already inside. Let's see. Hot water from the stove. Bite your teeth together. Swab. Swab. Shift change at the tower site? - You know I work there? - You told me yourself. - No, I haven't. - Sorry, my bad. Somebody else told me then. So, why are you here? I want out of here. I saved some money and could sell my bike. Thanks. I want to go somewhere, where one can start over. What's stopping you? Just need to start driving. Change your address, Robert Hahn travelling. I know, but... I'm not alone. There's a girl, she's from the East. She's got no papers here. - I want to take her along. - Her name? Inge Zimmermann. Send her to me some time, maybe I can do something. Thanks. So, here's my telephone number. I'm always available. If you want to pay me back. - Does this hurt? - Uh, uh. Okay, that's it. It's soaked through, needs new bandaging. How's the appetite, hungry? Are you thirsty? Some milk? How about a bottle of beer? Few breads, some meat? Need to go to the pharmacy anyway, swabs and penicillin. Got nothing left here. - I'll bring some food. - I'll give you money! No, thanks, it's all good. You know you're damn lucky? If the ligaments had been cut... No one would've been able to fix it. [merchant chanting] How you doing, kid? Ok. - He's not here? - He left for the pharmacy. Tell me... What's with him? You saw him, completely gone. Used to be a great doctor, but now he's on the liquor. Took away his medical license 3 years ago. - Because of drinking? - No, that was later. Someone died under the knife. Negligence the courts said. Since then he's on it. Come here, eat this. But when he's clear, he's still up to speed. - You saw last night. - And now? He can't ever work again? In a few years, if he makes it. I didn't know all this. Nobody's business. Does he know, what we do? Doesn't want to, it's for the better. Finances him, after all. 20 swabs, kapiazole. Schwympartol. - Working again, doctor? - No, no, I'm not. But one needs a home pharmacy. A few more ointments. Cod liver and Ichtyone. And sleeping pills too. Didn't forget anything? I stopped at the market after work. They have everything. - Don't want you to starve here. - Do you always cook yourself? Sometimes, sometimes not. Food's not important. This mess is over now. Now I'll be in charge here. Sure, Inge, but not here. I want to leave, somewhere. I want to take you along... - Don't you want to? - I can't leave here without papers. I know someone who could help. You need to go there. Who is it then? He's with the police. Police? It says the funfair owner's been robbed of 4000 marks. How interesting. Who's not telling the truth? If I say it's not even 2500, then that's the truth, clear? And how much did your father get? Stop, babe. You can't complain, no? I'm just asking. One never knows with you. I don't want to anymore. I'll tell him that. When we started it was all fun and games, but now... I must get out. Then do it, for God's sake. Want me to talk to him? He'll laugh in your face. Laugh in my face? Why? Because I don't want to lose you? What kind of man is that? Who knows? Sometimes I hate him... Sometimes I don't. This can't end well, Rob. One day they'll catch you... It's always the same end. Is it worth it? I have to get out. He'll have to let me go. I now realize how dangerous this all is. Before meeting you, I was never scared. And now? And now... The crickets. It'll rain tomorrow, says the newspaper. What's this nonsense? No excuses, doctor. Get on the scales. - 120 kilos, I bet you. - You're insane, boy. What's this? You're cheating! Doctor, 120 kilo is too much! We'll butcher you at Christmas! - Talking to me like that! - What? - Have to deduct the shoes! - As if! What's going on here? Seems you're better. I need you today. - It's out of the question. - Why, I'm able to go. You can't, what for? - It's my business. - What do you need him for? So he'll stay here. What's the plan? If the doctor could leave us alone for a moment? Well, it's a pity. I really would've needed you. - I'll come anyway. - No, it's for the best. Here's your share, from the fair. Of course you'll also be included today, quietly. Say, where's your pistol? Pistol? Oh, in the basement. Fritz knows where to find it. Werner? - Yes? - Come here. Werner, stop this. Stop what? Can't be a bit more precise? Werner, I never asked what you really do. I don't know it, I admit. But I can also guess. You do horrible, dangerous things. Let's not start pointing fingers here, you or me. It doesn't matter. But listen to me for once! Change your life, please! You can still do it! Get a job, go to work! Get insurance, a bank account? Retire in comfort? Can't wait for that! You always want everything at once! Nobody can wait anymore! Yeah, I don't want to wait! I want to earn now! I want a nice car now, to travel the world now! I want to live now! Not when I'm turning sour! I don't want to think about following these ancient rules! As if nothing had happened. - Do I know what's tomorrow? - But no one knows that. But one can't always live lawless like that! A man needs securities, he needs order in life! Don't look at me like that. - What I am, it's no excuse for you. - I will live the way I want to! Securities, order... you wish! Do I know if I'll be enlisted tomorrow? If some nuke is dropped on my head the day after? You're yesterday's news! - Yes, maybe you're right. - Now leave me alone! Mind your own business, you're busy enough with that. So, professor, excited? Well, a bit. It's the first time after all. But Werner can rely on me. I'm sure. All notified except for Rob. 10pm, basement. - Where's Werner? - He's out. - I need to see him. - I think so does he. 10pm, basement. - What's up? - Big business tonight. I'm not doing it. What's that? Orders from above, all hands on deck. How's the miss? Under her thumb already? Werner won't accept it today. It's family day. But without me. - I'll wait for Werner- - Good luck, he's out with Willi. Over there. Another one. Always pissing. I'd rather be in Mallorca. With piano and violin. - Yes, please? - Excuse me... I took the 13 from Bromberger Platz... - ... to the last stop. - Yes, and? - Well, you understand... When I exited, I had... I noticed my small brown bag was missing, you see? Why are you here then? 13 is going to Spandau. And in such cases lost & found is responsible, Potsdamer Straße. Lost & Found, Potsdamer Straße. - Thanks. - Sure. What nonsense, should've taken care of it at 13's exit. - I didn't know it. - You've been here long enough! [unintelligible discussing] - So? - It looks good. Okay. Will I have one too? No, not you. - Short-sighted, huh? - Yes. - Where'd you come from, Rudi?! - Just ran away, boys. Werner said there'd be magic, don't want be stuck at home. - So, everyone here? - Even Rudi, just arrived. Rudi? Is he crazy? - Rob's missing, he won't come. - What does that even mean? - He doesn't want to. - I see, he doesn't want to. He was very nice, we went to the political police and well.. They wanted to know why I came over and what I did for a living. And so on... It's not final yet, but I think I will get a temporary visa. That'd be great, no? If only it were faster. - Did he ask about me? - Yes, he sends his regards. If only all police were like that. How romantic in the cottage, nice. Unfortunately, no time. I need you, get dressed. I won't come. I don't want to. We need to talk, Werner. They're waiting for you 30 minutes in the basement. 2 minutes to get dressed, clear? Sorry to have disturbed, my lady. But there is business to do, see? Hurry, and leave your bike. You'll be riding with me. Rudi? Rudi? Rudi? And with the stolen car you'll drive... right here. - Corner Flurstraße... - ...Leimweg. Yes, you'll be in the car with me and Rob. Otto and you, professor, you'll be on your bikes. Meeting at 1.45am, here. Schedule says the last bus enters the depot at 1.55am. 10 minutes later the transport arrives for all the earnings. Leaves us 9 minutes to cash in and get out. Has to run like clockwork. 1.56am we're in the cashier's room. Otto... and you, Willi. You intimidate the cashiers with your pistols, all while... Rob, the professor and I load all the cash. 1, 2, 3... until the whole cashier's room is empty. Me? - Forgot me, huh? - You're the most important man. At 1.48am, at the stop Dornegg, you'll enter the last bus and go to the depot. If someone asks, you're a trainee. We'll get you a proper jacket too. You'll keep your eyes open until we come. If something seems weird, you'll split and we'll meet here. Here, please keep the bus fare ready! Tonight it's us cashing in. Questions? Wouldn't it be better to wait for the cash transport to exit? - Grab that one? - A cash transport? The one with bulletproof windows? Two armed guards, old soldiers? Otto, Otto! We won't risk that. Something else. No shooting except emergencies. Can't I come along too? No, Rudi. You're still on sick leave. - I'll wait for you then. - It could take 4 hours, kid. - I don't care. - What are we doing until then? - I'll grab some sleep. - Yeah... - Me too. I'll go to the cinema, maybe. - Red Roses. - That tearjerker! Yeah, try getting tickets! It's always sold out. - Coming too, Rob? - Rob's staying with me. Otherwise you'll get lovesick and we'll have another problem. Remind me to get fuel, will you? Good luck. - For whom? - Doesn't matter. Ellen... Ellen, where is Werner? - What's with her... - Ellen, please! Rob's with him. Jealous? - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. - 30 litres. - Of course, 30 litres. - Where are you going? - Toilet, be right back. - Do you have a toilet? - Sure, it's over there. Thanks. Oil? Yes, of course. Yes. - Not much in there. - I've just had it changed! Fill up what's missing. 1.30am to 2am at the bus depot. Yes, a heist on the cashier's room. Can't speak anymore now. Watch out, they're armed. - Would you like a receipt? - Sure, I keep my books in order. Sure, a moment please. - 2 more hours to go. - Well... It's only trouble with my wife since taking on the late shift. \"Paule, can't come home quietly?\" That's what she always says. You come home quietly with those boots, she rants and- - Depot 3, night cashier, Berthold. - Criminal police. - Oh, really? - Is there still money? - Of course. - Get all the money out of there. That's something! - We're there in 30 minutes. - Of course, I understand. Criminal police, there's supposed to be a heist tonight. We have to lock the money! Police is here in 30 minutes! - Boy, you've got trouble. - For God's sake! Look at this damn mess! Gentlemen, exact time? - It's now... - Bell exactly at 1.49am, boing! There's the car! - What's up with you, nervous? - No, why do you ask? Not bad. I'm good. Bus is coming. What is it? Horrid weather. What's up with you? Need to fetch my bike. What line are you on? None, still training. Boy, you've chosen some job! It's a bit early. We still have 4 minutes. Last one... number 3. Attention, Berta 1 and Berta 7. Berta 1 blocks Gräußenweg. Berta 7 blocks Weidenheimer Straße. Watch check. 01:53am. Damn! Someone's coming! It's Fritz! Run, someone snitched! There's police everywhere! Damn. Quick, get in, all to the basement. But everyone on their own! Otto! Help! - Police! - Help, ow- Wasn't that someone calling for help? Berta 1, 7 and 12. Await further instructions. - Is Rudi here? - Not for two days. - Werner? - I don't know, I'm waiting too. - They had something planned. Must be something big. Nobody tells me anything. - Do you need anything? - No, I'm good, thank you. - Maybe a- - No, I must leave. A double cognac, please. So, tell us now. What blew your fuse there. There's explanations, no? Your wrecked nerves? Had a little breakdown there. I can even sympathize with that. You're a sensitive one. I know that. I can even picture someone like you... ... going to the police. No, I can't picture it. What number is that here? Fritz, come here. Call this number here. Let's see who picks up. Maybe you start talking? I've asked you a lot of questions. I don't get it. Werner wanted to call right after. Are you also scared? I'm always scared. Did you forget, how you came to us? Not even 30 pennies for the tram? Ripped sweatshirt, no dick in your pants... and now? Bank account, nice bike. A girl too. Criminal police. Thiel's the name. Yes, I've snitched on you. I've called the police. It was my only chance not to go to prison! And yours too! I don't want this anymore, see? I'm fed up with all this. I don't want it anymore! Also tell them about the basement? No. I even believe you. Not much time here, what shall we do with him? Pig! If we let him walk, we're done here. Guaranteed. He'll be singing at the police in 30 minutes. - Right? - Exactly! - And tomorrow we're in prison. So what shall we do? I knew what I'd do, but... Since it was one of you, you'll have to decide it. Vote. So... Otto? - He'll have to go. - How? - Shoot him, no other way. Thanks. Fritz? Snitch eats a bullet. - No need to discuss it. - Good, and you, Willi? Already said we can't let him walk. - But shooting him brings even more heat. - Rudi? - We can't just kill him, we must- - Good, it's fine, professor? So? One like that... kill him! Good. You do it. You decided, so you'll also shoot him. Don't be scared, he'll never shoot. Why look at me like that? Werner... you said... Shoot, you said. - He's still alive. - Yes, he's still breathing. Rudi, go get him. Otto, take my car, and hurry. It's already 2.30am. - Something must've happened. - Nonsense. Don't get nervous! He's wasted. He'll come to his senses. Why did I do that? - Why did I- - Shut up and get a grip! This idiot, this joker! How could I know he'd shoot? Didn't you want that? Me, why me? You took a vote, that's it. Why did I do that? It's too late. It's too late now. How did this happen? Werner? - I ask you, what happened? - You ask him! You think you're not part of this too? We must all distance ourselves! That's why we did it! One snitched, one had to kill him. But for the sole reason that it's not all of us in prison! - And what happens to me? - Each on their own from here. It's not as easy as that. What if the professor snitches? Then we have to kill him too? One after another, there's no ending there. I don't know you anymore. A human life... extinguished. I don't want to see you again. If you wish! Don't want to see you again... Good Lord, what have we done. - Now we all have to pay. - Such bullshit you're saying! Something happened. Yes, take a look. Stop with this nonsense! Do it yourself, I'll leave! Werner, you can't leave me here. You need to help me after this! Leave me, you four-eyed weasel! I don't understand you. What's the big problem now? What can happen if everyone shuts their mouth? They'll go easy on him, I'll get him a good lawyer. Say something here! You can thank him. Did you call us? - Yes, it's over there. - Let's go! Block the right basement exit! Special operations to- Gröger, Geschle-! Warn them, they're all armed! You head to the left wing! They're all armed! Berta 1 to 4, cover the exits!\n"

[chatting] [school bell] So, Brina... whatta ya want to... Sabrina? Huh? Huh? Go away! It won't work, Sabrina. You promised Hilda and Zelda you'd go to school. Why didn't you warn me about those Chipmunk Chews? If I'd have known you were going to steal them from my pantry, I'd have put up a big warning sign! Can you believe this? Why'd I have to be allergic to fur sugar? I'd say you got your just desserts. Now come out or you'll be late for class. I can't go looking like this! [gagging, coughing sounds] Hey, the swelling'll go down in a couple of hours. At least you're not... late -- [suppressing a laugh] See ya after detention... [growls under her breath] There you are! Uh... Hi Cassandra. Hi, Sabrina! Hi Tiffany. Margaux. Here are those books, you know, from the time I borrowed your library card? Aahh! They are so overdue. You really should have reminded me! Your late fees are going to be epic! [strained grunts] By the way, I like your hair-- Really? Sure. With your face that puffy, you really can't tell how bad your hair usually looks. [giggles] [groan] Start of another day... Aahh! Mr. Snipe's chemistry test. I can't look! Hey! I got an A-minus! You did? Maybe I did okay for once... Oh, no! So, uh... You didn't get an A? Whoa. Yup, An F is definitely not an A. Hey, look! Oh, no! I skipped one! I filled in all the wrong blanks! If you go talk to him, I'll bet Mr. Snipe would understand You think so?! I mean, it really wasn't my fault... much. Can't hurt asking. See ya in the library. Right! The science project! You sure you still want me for your partner? Of course! It's not like you mess up all the time-- Ohmygosh! I just messed up! Again! What do you mean? I was supposed to help Ms. McGrooney with some, uh, off-campus stuff this lunch period! Ugh, she's going to bury me!! Double time, Spellman! Yes, Ms. McGrooney! Oh, here, let me help! You did that on purpose! I was just trying to help. See, Ms. McGrooney? Listen up, class. Pick a partner! But Cassandra and I are the only ones in the class. Makes it easy to pair off, doesn't it? Time to work on Broomstick Duet Drills. Start with the One-Hand Double-Tag Relay. I want to see it in three days. Well, you really can't do a One-Hand Double-Tag Relay unless your broom runs at 5-point-0. Mine already runs at 6-point-0. What's yours? Coal-powered? Okay, okay. I'll go to the Netherworld and get an upgrade. I'm pretty sure I have enough credits. Well, hurry up then! We only have three days. 'Nice cheeks, Sabrina.' 'Oh, and here's an F on your chem test.' 'Hey, hurry up with that equipment, Spellman!' 'Your broom is sooo slow!' Whoa! [angry grunt] This is the worst day of my life! [frustrated grunts] Whoa! The Doors to Dreamland! Hey, there! You in the goo! How'd you like a change of scenery? Who... who are you? The best friend you'll ever have! You know about Dreamland, right? All the cool kids do-- Well, it's a place where you have fun and forget your problems-- It is! And I'll bet your problems weren't even your fault! You can say that again! But my aunts say I'm too young. I won't tell if you won't. I - I only have enough credits to get my broom upgraded. For you, a first-time special. Only three credits. I... I don't know... Is that me? In there? Your every wish is our command! Wow, this is so cool! I'm a princess! Live a little. Be the queen! I - I don't even know where to start! Does this give you any ideas? We're not worthy! Oh, mistress! How can we serve you? Pssst! The secret's in the snap! Oh, yeah! This rocks! Mistress, I beg you! His Royal Highness Harvey is trapped by a Dragon and needs rescuing! [screams] Little help here! I thought this was my fantasy-- [rewinding noise] Oh, Most Wonderful Person in the Universe, we're almost done with the chemistry test papers! Then we'll work on those library late fees! This is great! 'Yes, Mistress.' 'Whatever you desire. Oh, great Sabrina.' 'All hail Sabrina!' Oof! Hey! Oh, hi Brina. Hey! Where were you yesterday? Why? Where was I supposed to be? Ohmygosh! The library! Our science project! Oh, Harvey! I'm sooo sorry! That's okay, I guess. Just let me have your notes so I can start outlining. You mean the notes I was supposed to do last night? Sabrina! This assignment is really important! Look, Harvey, I'll meet you at lunch, I promise, okay? And if I blow it this time, you can pick another partner. Deal? Hmmm. [humming] [gobbling sounds] Salem! [belch] Some of these kids pack a mighty tasty lunch! I heard about McGrooney's relay duet. Didja get your broom upgrade? Uh, well see, I was, uh, a credit short, and-- Say no more. I only have one credit left, but you can have it. That would be perfect! Salem! How can I ever thank you! Don't mention it. Huh? Hey, Sabrina! How are you gonna get an upgrade without your broom?! Why do I have a bad feeling about this? I need to spend this on my broom. This is so not cold enough! Ice! Now! [straining] Yes, your greatness! [deep breath] [blows] [cough, cough] Marshmallow, m'lady? [alarm rings] Oh, no -- My time can't be up already -- ! 'Fraid so. I get it. 'Time flies when you're having fun.' Time to return to the real world. Hey, wait a minute! What's that? Hello? It's the real world. Like where you live? You outline the chapters and I'll check the internet-- But... but that's Harvey! [gasp] What time is it? I'm supposed to meet him... I mean, I was supposed to meet him. Looks like he got another science partner. Oh well, no sense going back now. You know the rules. You wanna stay, you gotta pay! Whooooaa! [laughs] [sad sigh] Sabrina? Hey kiddo, what's wrong? My whole entire life! Yesterday my face was the size of a pumpkin! I flunked my chemistry test! I forgot I was supposed to help Mrs. McGrooney, and my broom's too slow! Plus Harvey dumped me as his science partner. Harvey did? That doesn't sound like him. But he did! And all I did was miss a meeting with him yesterday. Oh, and I didn't do my notes. And I forgot I was supposed to meet with at lunch today. And Harvey got upset at you? Oh that's so unfair. Right! None of it was really my fault. Maybe you were distracted by your need for a broom upgrade? That's right! I took my broom to the Netherworld for an upgrade. No, you didn't! My broom! Guilty! [laughs] I'd be great as a TV lawyer. I really oughtta share my talent with the world. So you know I wasn't getting an upgrade. I know you were doing something. And I know it cost you some credits. Come on. Spill. I went to Dreamland. Twice! [sputters] Dreamland?! But that's off-limits! You know better than that! [sobbing] You can't run off to Dreamland every time you mess up. Sometimes life is so hard... And sometimes it's so good. And all the time it's crazy and mixed-up. But if you go run off and hide, you'll miss the whole thing. Don't miss your life, Sabrina. Yeah, you're right. Sabrina! Cassandra! Cassandra! Sabrina! Are you in here?! [sigh] Great! I blew all my credits and my broom's still not upgraded! Hmmm. Bet I can get some credits for that upgrade. This troll owes me for a hot tip at the goat races. Meet you back here in twenty! And no more Dreamland, okay? What am I worried about? You're broke! Over here, Cassandra. Ready to practice? I mean, once you finish sweeping up under there and all-- I wasn't sweeping up, Cassandra. That's about all your broom's good for, Sabrina. Hey, you were supposed to get an upgrade! I - I didn't have the credits. You don't have the credits so I'm going to get a lousy grade. That is so not acceptable -- Sorry, Cassandra. I - I'm trying to get some more credits -- Ugh! don't waste my time! Just take 'em and go. And hurry up! I won't go to Dreamland again. I won't! But you owe me! Big time! Whatever you say, Cassandra! That was too easy... I bet she's up to something. That little sneak! Can't use my card. Aunt Enchantra would bust me. There's got to be another way in! Perfect! Hmpf! Hello? Where's the napkin? Think, people, think! Hold it right there, Sabrina! I will, as soon as you give me a napkin! Forget your napkin. What about my credits?! Aaahh! Deal with her! And make it... messy! [growls] [screams] Finally! A little service around here! Hey, wait a minute. I thought I told the dragon to take care of you! You mean take care of her. Whoooaaa! Let me go! [gasp] That really is Cassandra! Oh no! I have to help her. My time can't be up -- ! Ah, but it is -- Noooooo! No. I can't go! I have to help Cassandra! Whoa, first time I ever said that... You know the rules. Your time's up. Now move it! I can't leave Cassandra stuck in here! You mean the intruder? We'll deal with her -- Oh, yeah? Well... You-caaaan't catch-me! This was your fantasy. Now it's your nightmare! Talk about a late fee! Not good. Really not good! Mmmmm. Snack time. What exactly is that supposed to mean? Aaahhh! \"The Management is not responsible for items left behind.\" The blonde kid's time is up, you're left behind, so -- I get to be not responsible! [struggling] Hey, hey, hey! My hair! [grunts] You have so crossed the line, buster! [angry grunts] Oooh! [laughter] Hey. That tickles! [laughs] Let her go! Let her go! [low growl] [deep breath] [blows] [struggling grunts] [strained grunts] [giggles] Stop tickling me! Wait a sec -- that thing's ticklish! CHARGE! [building laughter] That's right! Laugh it up, Ash-Breath! [strained grunt] [startled gasp] Aaahh! Cassandra!!! [screams] Quick! That One-Handed Double-Tag Relay! How's it go again? Honestly, if you'd ever bother studying--! Not now, Cassandra! Okay, okay! Toss me my broom while you sweep under-- Got it! Aaahhh! [calls out] Now stand up! Ready?! Not bad for a coal-powered broom. Hey! Whoa! Look out! [screams] [giggles nervously] Uh, no harm, no foul, right, Cassandra? Not exactly, Sabrina. Although that One-Handed Double-Tag Relay you just pulled off wasn't too bad... Cassandra, you trespassed in Dreamland. And Sabrina, well. Missed classes. Lying to your friends. Sabrina, we really need to talk. So when I came back and you weren't in the gym, I figured where you'd gone -- Didya have to bring McGrooney? Her whole class cuts and you don't think she's gonna go looking? Sabrina? You in here? Hey, Harvey! Over here! You wanna go ride bikes? Can't. I haven't finished scrubbing the floor yet... [shudder] That's harsh! Just because you messed up on that science project? Well, that... and a few other things, too. Want some help? Thanks, Harvey. But that's okay. I messed up and I have to make it right. See ya. Okay. See ya. Wow, Sabrina. I'm impressed. When I mess up, I pretend I was possessed by an alien life form. Hmmm. Maybe that's why I got turned into a cat...\n"

      "{\\an8}TO MARIE-LOUISE… Michel? Yeah! Come on up. Coming. - What are you up to? - Aren't you asleep? With all I have to do tomorrow? All this crap, in this heat. It's the pits. Even without the heat, it's the pits. We weren't building Versailles. Those were different times. Nowadays, it's grab the money and run. Sure, take my beer. I'll go get another. - Hi, Corinne. - Hi. Did I wake you up, honey? Weren't you at your mother's? - I figured you would come home. - And, here I am. What are you up to? Nothing. - Will you be here tomorrow morning? - I don't think so. Okay, get off to bed, my lovely. How's things with your mom? Not great right now. Pity. Goodnight, daddy. You don't usually park out front. Yeah, I'm leaving right away. Where are you going? What are you, a cop? How about you, man? No sign of a job? - I'm getting plenty of mail. - Really? Yeah, mostly taxes and final reminders to pay. Motherfuckers. If you could wait a bit for the 3,000 bucks. Give them to the kid. I already owe two months allowance to her mother. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, all right. Shit, crane operators like you aren't easy to find. Yeah, so they say. It pisses me off because I dreamed I was at the controls. And you, are you okay? I get by. I don't have much choice. That's just how things are. In my family, we've been getting by for three generations. Hello? What about Lisa? Everything okay? - I guess I'm lucky. - Yeah, I guess. Right then, I'll be going. Here, I got you something. - What is it? - Look inside. See that little light at the back? In the north, it's called the end of the tunnel. Funny, right? Very kind of you. - You all right? - Never better. Bye. Do you need anything? If I do, I'll call you. Bye, buddy. Bye. Bruno? Was that you calling just now? Yeah. Say, for 8,000 bucks, aren't you taking me for a bit of a fool? Where were you? Over at Michel's. His truck woke me up. - His truck? - Yes. Fred, what are you doing? I'm sleeping. Were you drunk last night? No. What are we eating tonight? Be honest, are you only here for my ass and my food? To be honest, I'm not sure. Watch it, you. You think you're funny? No. Idiot. Fred, come finish the Lego. - Coming. - Give your mom a kiss first? - I'm very popular this morning. - Yes. I've got to get going. Do you have any cash? Yes, I think I have about 15 bucks in my pants. Take them. - No, don't worry, I'll manage. - Take them. I'm telling you I'll manage. Kevin, your dad is coming to get you. What time is he gonna be here? As soon as he can. Goodbye, my love. Fred! - What is it? - If he isn't here at 10:00 a.m... Yes, if he's not here, I'll take him to daycare. See you tonight. - Hello. - Hi, Corinne. Hold on a second. Where are you going, Fred? I'll be right back. Michel? He's not here. - Apologies yet again. - No problem. You okay, champ? Go around that side. I'll drop him off at the park after lunch. Could you… - Well, okay, why not. - Thank you. Goodbye, Fred. PLEASE WAIT… TRANSACTION CANCELED Useless piece of crap. Your unemployment benefit is two months late. I'll let you have a small overdraft, a very tiny one. Not too small, though. Go get the balls, guys! - You… - Come on! Come on! Good morning. - Good morning. - I want to get this analyzed. My chick told me it's dangerous. - Your chick. - My girlfriend? My wife told me it was dangerous. She's right. Michel called. He'll call you at home at 1:00 p.m. Really? Okay. Here, this is for the groceries. Can't you get them? Sure, but what do I get? Salted pork. Okay, salted pork. - I'll go myself. - Thanks. What can I do to make you happy? Tell me. Give me a raise. Do you always think about money? Shit. - Hello? - It's Michel. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - I have a little job for you. - Are you kidding? - No. I need a favor. - Right now? - Are you free? - I always am these days. - Okay. Remember that truck? - Yes. - I left it in Ventilles. - Near the stadium. - How do you know that? - I happened to pass by there. I need you to take it to the place I'll tell you about. It can't be far. I have to be here at 4:00 p.m. for the kid. No, it will be fine. Can you drive a big beast like that? - You're joking. No worries. - Good. You know the closet in my room? Near the bottom, there's a pair of red socks. The keys are inside. - Inside the socks? - Yeah. I'll give you the route. What have you made? A drawing. - What's that? - An elephant. That's not an elephant, it's a horse. It's an elephant. Of course it is, silly me. - What did you do today? - I drove a big truck. - As big as the Lego? - Much bigger. A hundred times bigger. - A truck like the ones on the highway. - Oh, yes. Big trucks with a steering wheel this big. Come here. - That's enough now! - Don't worry, we're just playing. Go up to your room. It's time for bed. If you think I like doing housework at 10:00 p.m., you're wrong. At the moment, I'm the one doing the housework. - And other than that, what did you do? - Nothing, as usual. Don't say \"nothing\". I called. Nobody was home. I gave Michel a hand. He drove a big truck! - Did you drive a truck? - Yes. - Is this a joke? - If you think it is, why do you ask? Kevin, go up to your room. Well done. Get off my back. Six months ago, you had no job and I didn't say a word. - Have you forgotten that? - I wasn't drinking. Two or three beers is drinking? You're so unfair, Lisa, it's unbelievable. Are you on your period? Cut the crap. You disappear all day and I'm the one who's premenstrual? - What a convenient excuse. - You're just tired. Hello. Michel here, leave a message. Thank you. Do you have the keys to Michel's? No, it was open. Is he in trouble? No. Tell me if I'm bothering you. Do you want to sit here for a bit? Look, I know I'm a pain in the ass. My mother was always nagging my father. When he came home late, she assumed he was cheating on her. But it was worse than that. He was always out with his pals. You're right, that's worse. But I know a trick no friend can ever do. Do you want me to show you? Watch out, my cigarette. This is a great sofa. It's firmer than mine, isn't it? - It's just that yours makes a noise. - You're right. Watch out! If Corinne comes in… Turn off the light. Turn it off! You're crazy! Wait, it's stuck! Ouch! - Where are you going? - I'm going to check something. Did I wake you up? No. Go to sleep. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. - Fred. - Everything okay? - Yes. - What's wrong? Nothing, I thought I heard the little one crying. Hi, Jacky. A Martini. - Seen Michel recently? - No. Thank you. Hello, warriors! \"Warriors\", very funny. You're an activist, you read Libération and think that makes you a revolutionary. I was kidding. Stop it, Yvan. - I'm allowed to talk, ain't I? - Guess about what? Right. Because if you hadn't pushed us into occupying the factory, we might still have a job! You're crazy. You start something, you have to see it through. It's easy for you to give advice! You're working! Where did you get that idea? What do you mean? I mean that His Lordship is a driver now! He has a nice white truck. - Jacky, tell him to lay off me. - Hey, it's the truth, isn't it? Weren't you showing off that big ass truck of yours yesterday? Yup, bigger than your wife's ass. - Cut it out! - They're both crazy. Stop or I'll call the police! That's enough! - Fuck. Asshole. I'm bleeding. - Let me see. Here. - Stop it! - Here we go again. - All you had to do was hide. - You should have warned me. - Leave it to me. - Whatever. So, these joints… …they're not yours? - No, sir, I swear. - Do you often have 800 francs in cash? It's my mother's unemployment. Mouloud, I know your mother. She's never worked. So… She'll be getting it soon! I swear it's true. If he says it's his mother's unemployment, what can we do? I'll book them and be right back. I know you. We've met before. Six months ago. Same place, same story. - Perhaps. - What? Could be. Have you nothing better to do than fight? Well, no, that's the problem. We have nothing else to do. Do you want to file a complaint? No. Nor does the other guy. It is me that should be complaining. For pissing us off and wasting our time. If you were kids, I would understand. Were you drunk? Not yet. Well. I'll keep you in until midnight. To piss you off and waste your time. Okay? It's your turn now. Have a nice evening. Michel? Corinne? He's got nothing left, the asshole. Why are you here? I just dropped by. Where's Michel? No idea. Didn't you see him tonight? No. Yesterday neither. I was at Pachouba. I came back on my Vespa. Damn, that club is a dump. - Do you never go there? - No, where is it? \"Where is it\". Oh, shit! Your hands are cold! It's the bike. I always takes me ages to warm up again. My head is spinning. I'll say goodnight to Lisa for you. You're not even funny. Fred! Yes? Where have you been? - What? - Where have you been? Nowhere. I got a mail from ANPE for a job. I have to go see them. Great, but where have you been? At the police station. The police station? - Who were you fighting this time? - With Yvan. Nothing serious. Look at me. It was nothing. Really. Don't you two ever get tired of it? It really sucks. - You never got into a fight? - Not like that. Once I kicked a guy who was following me in the balls. It felt weird on my foot. I'm actually really glad I'm a woman. I get why you're scared walking around with that between your legs. It's so fragile. That's why they need to be caressed so often! Exactly. What are you doing here? - Am I bothering you? Are you cleaning? - Yes. I only have the vacuuming left. - What brand is it? - A Hoover, the only real ones. Come in. I want to apologize for yesterday. It was stupid of me. It was me, I started it. You know, since the factory closed, there are 200 of us feeling like idiots. Of course. Don't just stand there, come on in! Why don't we go for a drink instead? Just a lemonade. What do you say? I'll just do my nails and be right there. Those assholes kept me in till midnight. I have two kids so they gave me a dressing-down and let me go. If you're single, they treat you like shit. - You're not single. - For the police, I am. You're not the only one to piss everybody off. If you're gonna be a pain in the ass you can drink your lemonade on your own. - No one will ever change you. - Not you, anyway. - Yvan, where you are going? - What do you mean? I mean, where you are going? I'm going to look at a crane with Fred. Okay? Where are we going? To Jacky's? - Hang on, he'll lecture us. - You're crazy. We should have been building that. All the rain must have pissed them off. - You know the factory has been sold? - Really? Yeah. The mayor assigned it as a sort of recreation center. Why are you stopping? - Wanna take a look? - Why? I don't know. No particular reason. Does it bother you? No, okay, let's go. Up there, that was my studio. Did you see how they gutted it all? You could say it makes it nice and airy! We weren't spoiled for windows. Let's take a look at it. Isn't this cool? Let's do a tour of the premises. Moron. It will only depress you. Like everything else. PLANT OCCUPIED, SOLIDARITY, ALL ON STRIKE ACTION AND UNION TO FIGHT BACK It's falling apart, isn't it? My workshop was right there. What a mess. We worked like slaves in here. But it was better than doing housework. That's for sure. - Don't get too close. - Are you feeling dizzy? Wanna go for a drink? Just come on. Come here. Let's go. - Are you coming or what? - Yeah. Come on, buddy! What are you guys up to? What are we up to? Who does he think he is? Fuck you. You too! Get the fuck off me! Don't fucking move! Knock it off! Let him go, damn it! No! No! Shit, are you fucking crazy? - Let's get out of here! - Let me go! You are through to the police. Hold the line. You are through to the police. Hold the line. - Fuck! - Police here, how can I help you? A bag. Shit! My card. What are you doing here? - Aren't you at your mother's? - Look at your face. You look scary. - Go to your mother's. - You can't say that. You're not my father. Ok, but grab your stuff and go to your mother's! - Okay. - And get moving. - Did anyone call for your father? - My grandmother. Why? - Apart from that? - Someone called Bruno. That's all. - What did he want? - I have no idea! - What's going on? - No, nothing. Come on. I'm warning you, we can't be late. Yeah, right in the face. He's home. Michel? - He's not here. - He's behaving stupidly lately. He's left the place open. Hi, Michel here. Leave a message. Thank you. Hello, it's Fred. Hope you listen to this. I need to talk to you. See you at the Foosball. Know which one? You absolutely must come. I'll wait for you over there. Okay? Bye. I'd like to talk to Lisa, please. He didn't mean to kill him. Yvan that went ballistic. And what about the truck? It was a small job. It may have nothing to do with it. Do you realize what you're saying? A guy is dead. Why don't you go to the cops? You did nothing! So they can lock me up? I would never get out. I just need to find out some info so they believe me. And what do I do? Tell them I left to find a job. The ANPE thing. I'll go tomorrow. I might find a job. Everything ok? Isn't it obvious? Why is he hassling us? I just wanted to know if... You don't want anything! You're pissing us off! Go and play with your test tubes! Get lost! - Is he still bothering you? - No, it's all right. He's a boss. Yes, that's the way. Do you have any money? Don't worry. I'll get by. You have a hard-on! Where are you going? To E4. I took a truck there the other day. No, no-one is allowed here except the trucks. I want to check the load. It's forbidden, I told you. Are you deaf? - Do you take me for a fool? - Hands off me! Intervention E4-E5, send reinforcements. Okay, I'm on my way. You're not so cocky now. - Hi, Jumbo! - Hello. - A half. - Right away. Hi, Fred! Everything okay? - Have you seen Michel at all? - No. Why? Did he do this to you? - Hi, guys! - Hi, Geneviève. - Want a game? - No. - Come on, just a quick one! - No, I said! - Come on, let me school you. - Go on, sudden death. Sudden death? Fuck, you're a hard man! Not too sudden, though. Fred, Michel on the phone! Hello? Where are you? - Why? What's happening? - Yvan is dead. Yvan? He's dead? Ever since I shifted your truck, all hell has broken loose. What do you mean, he's dead? We were at the factory, he wanted to see his workshop again. We had a fight with two bastards who killed him. Everyone will think I killed him, because we had a fight yesterday. Hello? Hello? Michel! - Who are these guys? - I don't know! They were in a van at your house. Shit, Fred. Go to the cops. And tell them what? Everything you know. - Hi Jeanne, how are you? - What about you? - You don't look good. - I'm fine. Have you seen Michel? Yes, this morning. He was as bust up as you are. Did you party together last night? Did he say anything in particular? He didn't mention you, anyway. When? What did he do, exactly? You're acting strange! He ate something and made a call. Who did he call? A guy. Who? Do you know his name? Yes, why? So why don't you tell me? I'm done with all your fucking secrets. He never tells me anything either. It's shit! There's nothing to say. I just want the name. Mandor. His name is Mandor. Bruno Mandor? Yes. Happy? Is that what you wanted? - Do you need a ride? - I'm okay. - Not going home? Where will you sleep? - I'll be fine. Last night, I was drunk. You can come over. I won't eat you. Right, show me your sad, puppy-dog eyes, I love that. Thank you. The tuna sandwiches have gone bad. Leave the keys at the corner shop. Say hello to Lisa for me. Yeah. What does this guy do? Mandor? He worked at the factory. What kind of work? A bit of everything. Michel worked for him. At least, I think so. Remember the ANPE thing. - Ah, yes, shit. - Go tomorrow. It would be dumb not to go. - Okay. - Promise? Well… …I want to say so many things. Me too. Lots and lots. Bye. It's almost time to go to bed. Yes. Kevin, where is your bike? Outside. Sorry, I scared you. These houses all look the same. - Are you Lisa Mandini? - Yes. Your friend, I mean your boyfriend, Frédéric Capber, is he at your place? No. He went to look for work. - When did he leave? - At 12:00 p.m. One of his colleagues had a fall at the factory. - I heard. - Did you know he died? And you also know that they had a fight yesterday. - That was nothing. - Of course it wasn't! But it's weird that he's not here, right? What do you want me to do about it? Aren't you inviting me in? No. The kid is sleeping. Anyway, at this time of day, it's no time for paying visits anyway. Well, listen. I don't consider Fred to be public enemy number one. I would just like him to come and see me. This has even my home address. He already knows the one for the police station. Goodbye. Goodnight. Frédéric Capber! Good morning. I have nothing for a crane operator. Have you already worked on the 7-88? - No, but I could. Doesn't seem too hard. - I saw your CV. You should be okay. It is a new site. There is no room for error. Show me what you can do. - You better be good. - Why? I saw that you occupied the premises of your last employers. Is that on file? I didn't do it because it was fun. I only read the files, I don't write them. Pick up three or four beams over there and stack them neatly, without breaking anything. One by one. Okay. Hello. Hello. My colleague would like you to call him. Are you pressuring me? He's just turning the screws. You won't forget to call him? I never forget anything. Your front light is broken. Good morning, madam. Good morning. - I hope I'm not disturbing. - Are you from Ventilles? Yeah, how do you know that? Just by chance. That's the only way I ever find out anything around here. Tea? I'm looking for Mr. Mandor. He's gone, Mr. Mandor. Hightailed it in the night. Do you know this guy? He wouldn't have stolen a truck, would he? Could be. He's very good, Mandor, at covering up the big bosses' crap. In those cases, does he call on some guys in a van? Juvisy's thugs! They would do anything for 2,000 bucks. Who are these guys? I don't know their names and I don't care. Well, I do. They killed someone. I don't want to go to jail for them. I don't know everything but I know where Mr. Mandor stashes his stuff. - What kind of stuff? - No idea. I never dared to look for fear of seeing photos of his bitches. Get out of here, please! - The stairs behind the kitchen! - There? - Where the hell is he? - Get back out that way! Yes, hold on. - This is the Jacquard Laboratory. - It's me. - Fred? - Can you join me when you're done? - Yes, but where? - A motel. Write down the address. Yes. Go on. The one we saw once near the A86. - Miss! - Yes, just a moment. What about the ANPE job? - I went there. - Yes. I did the test, it went well but they were like, \"We'll contact you.\" - There were seven of us. - I can't talk to you now. - You coming? I'll be waiting. - Yes, I'm coming. Friday, at 3:30 p.m. Is that okay? That's fine. Goodbye. Thank you. Come in. I'm soaking wet. I'll be right back. I brought you some clean clothes. - Thank you. Where's Kevin? - His dad will bring him back at 10:00 p.m. - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm okay. How did you come? By taxi. Fifty bucks. You know how it is. How did you pay for the hotel? I maxed my credit card. No, I wasn't really scared. - You remember that storm three years ago? - Yeah. I was in my crane, 30 meters in the air, and the wind suddenly started gusting. I've never been sailing but it must be like that, in a storm. I should have been scared to death. But I had something to do. I had to move this three-ton beam hanging on the end of my lever. It's all in the wrists. I put it down like a feather. There is nothing to freak out about. It's when you have nothing to do that you get scared. This is the first time that you invite me to a hotel. You're not hard to please. On the contrary. I am very picky. I don't really see it, your pal Michel. When I first met you, I heard all about your big mouth! Only one person stood up for you. It was Michel. I know. What are you going to do? I don't know. You told someone I was here? No, nobody. Shit! It must have been that asshole, Jacquard. That fucker rummages in my desk. - What do you mean? - I must have left the address around. Fuck this! Good thing I stashed my bike. Damn, I had a feeling! Those bastards! Give me my jacket. Quick! Where will we meet? At the station, okay? Bye! - Is he in there? - No. He left. He has done nothing. He's scared of going to jail. - We'll see. - Did Jacquard warn you? You have good accomplices. You're talking to me about accomplices? Very funny! But if you continue this little game, I'll take you into custody. Two cyclists saw him yesterday near the factory. I get here, he leaves. I have to run after him as if he was guilty. - It doesn't look good for him. - It always looks bad for the same people. - I'm a cop, not God. - That's lucky. As for God, fuck him. Amen to that. Well, have you seen the cop? - Yeah, I saw him. - Well? - You know I have his home address. - What difference does that make? A cop never gives out his address. He's a good guy, Fred. Good or not, cops put folk behind bars. It gives me the creeps, understand? People like us, when we do, we get screwed big time. No one will care how long I stay there! I'd rather see you in jail than six feet under. I want you to get out of this mess. Can't you understand that? Fred, I'm scared you'll do something stupid. You think I'm enjoying this? I thought you might be. Tell me, what do you want me to do? I want you to talk to that cop. Not at the police station. At his house, you risk less. Just talk to him. That's all. This guy is impossible. What do you want? Ah, yes. Come in. Join me? No. It's good that you came. Well, I mean, it's better for you. We'll… Let's talk, ok? - Have a seat. - There? That's right. So, here I am. It's what you wanted. It's Lisa who... Great, the TGV. The modern world right under the nose of the Middle Ages. With its tribes, its vandals, its officials. It's not the town, it's not the countryside… It's all just shit. For you too. It's all just shit. So… What's the story? What do you mean the story? It's a story about... Hey! Hey? You could tell me anything, I'd have forgotten it an hour from now. Come on, let me go. I'll sleep for a bit and we'll start over later. - Let me go! - Yes. - Hey! - Hey. Come on. I'm going to sleep now. Hey. Hello, it's me. Leave a message, thank you. Hello? It's Lisa. We met earlier at the motel. Are you there? I wanted to know if Frédéric Capber was at your place. Call me back, thank you. Hello? Hello, is Lisa there? No, not yet. - Who's this? - Antoine Jacquard. Is it you? Asshole. - Did you get her? - No, she must be on her way to work. - Pity. - What am I supposed to do with these? Keep them. They look good on you. Yes, they're exactly my size. - Hello. - Hello. - No one called for me? - No, why? Nothing. Do you know young Weber came back for his HIV test? Really? Did you cut yourself? Yes, I was shaving. You're crazy! Better than being a piece of shit. You're lucky it's not tainted blood. Next time, I'll give you AIDS and hepatitis C combined. Fuck off and leave us in peace. - You two are completely crazy! - We're fine actually, thanks. You're fired! I can make it impossible for you to find things on this. Right? So, let me work in peace. Come on. Does your pal Michel have family? A girlfriend? I believe he has several. Let's start at the beginning. Fuck, I already told you everything twice! Now, it's enough. Yes, but I still want more. Do you want it in back-slang this time? A truck parked at your place while you were sleeping, right? And then? RECEPTION Then… I came to see you. You were completely wasted. Not a bad story. Not bad at all, but not enough to get you off the hook. It looks like a drunken brawl that ended badly. Pity. I had hoped you would come up with a better bullshit story. Come on, let's go! If you would only give me one good reason to believe you. Alright. How about I tell you I'm too stupid to have made it all up? Would that do? Sentinel One, this is Sentinel Four. Go ahead, Sentinel Four. Can you check out a blue Ford Transit, 89 Golf Alfa Romeo 91? Affirmative, 89 Golf Alfa Romeo 91, vehicle registered to a Juvisy company that went bankrupt three years ago. Thanks, over and out. - I told you... - I know, three times! - I only drink in the evenings. I'm ok now. - I hope so. - Are you the one in charge here? - Yes. Did someone come by to take a truck at E4? I do my best. There are only two of us for over 40 warehouses. - Who owns E4? - I don't know. The trucks come in and out, what are you here for? I'm gonna drag your ass to court. What's Mandor's wife like? A beautiful woman, a little worn out. She didn't look well. And me, how do I look? What can I say? Nothing. Say nothing. I told you that when I went into Michel's room, he was moaning about cracks in the ceiling. - So? - Maybe that has something to do with it. That's it. - What is it? - I'm not an engineer. - What the heck is that? - Construction panel designs. Okay, on our way. Hello, I'd like to see Frédéric Capber. I think he's here. - Nobody by that name here. - He must be with Inspector Barrère. I'd like to see him. The inspector hasn't come in. My boyfriend went to his house last night! What can I say? Either he's here, or he's with Inspector Barrère. I'm not budging from here. Got it? You need to calm down. Look into it if you want me to calm down. I trusted you, do something, dammit! Where is the other inspector? The Arab-looking one? Good morning. Would you follow me? I can't get through to Inspector Barrère. I know. Sit down. We can't reach him either. It's quieter in here. What does your friend do? - Nothing. - I meant before. He was crane operator. A good one, I believe. - He worked at the factory, right? - Yes. How long have you been living here? One year. And your child, how old is he? Five years old. I started young. I have a three-month-old baby. - Three months? - Yes. - Does he sleep at night? - No, it's a nightmare! You finally called Barrère. I was the one who told Fred to go see him. - Was it the right move? - Yes, of course. Nouchi, two brats have fallen off the roof of the mall. You know one of them. I'm on my way. Please go. I'm on it. - Hey, you've really put on the beef! - You can have it back whenever you like. Okay, explain it to him. - These, for example. - Yes? I don't know what they are. It's sets of 500 PRO construction panels. It is 60% asbestos fiber cement. Come over here. Oh my God. It's been banned for ages. In any case, normally, we only use it in large structures. These were in ordinary houses. Some clowns will do anything with salvage materials. What about money? With this shit, you could increase margins by 40%. But if you're caught, you're in big trouble. - Have you ever handled panels like this? - Maybe. - What is the factory going to become? - A leisure and nature center. If there's asbestos there and ecologists show up, that would be a mess. Maybe Mandor had to get rid of it. And he asked Michel to take care of the clear-up. For sure. And he'll get Mandor to own up. I'm a cop, after all. Wait! Stop! What day is it? Friday. That's Corinne's bike. She should be at school. - Who is Corinne? - Michel's daughter. I have to talk to her for a minute. Can I? - Are you waiting for someone? - My dad. Do you mind? When is he due? He couldn't say. He has a meeting somewhere near here. But then we're leaving to go on a trip. I'm warning you. - Do you know where his meeting is? - Not exactly. I think it's at the factory. Why? - I gotta go. - Won't you wait for him? No, I can't. - I thought Michel had no family. - The girl has nothing to do with this. Shit! Unbelievable! Stop doing that! In case you've kept anything else from me, I'd rather be sure you're here waiting for me. Aren't you calling the police? You know how to recognize a good cop? By his freedom of movement. Shit! Asshole. PLANT OCCUPIED, SOLIDARITY, ALL ON STRIKE Hello! Shit! Wait, I would… Fuck! Shit! Nouchi to Barrère, call Unit One. Nouchi to Barrère... For fuck's sake, Fred. I screwed everything up. Can you drive? Yeah, move over. You really screwed them over. We have to call Corinne at her mother's. Okay, we will. Her number is 60-42-29-66. My mother. Her number is 60-32-15-11. Her sister. Her number is 60-17-25-48. We have to call Fred. His number is 60-12-15-32. And Louis. His number is 60-12-15-58. And then… - For the bottle? - It's 4.90. Something smaller? No, keep the change. Can I sit down? I'm waiting for someone. Go ahead. Who are you waiting for, if you don't mind me asking? The ambulance, the cops, my wife. No one in particular.

Uh, it's Ms. Sorry,Ms., but, um- I meant to. You're not supposed to do that. Or the photos. That's why I tried it. Why? To see what would happen. Well, uh, I mean, I'm what happens. I-I ha-- I have to walk over, like I've done, and ask you to take a step back. And if someone doesn't, what then? I'm not sure. I've never had anyone not step back. I've only said it, like, four times, and every time they've done it. What if I'm your first? Non-stepper, I mean. Then what? Look, I'm off in 10 minutes. I'd probably stand here, make sure you didn't touch anything. Really? Pretty much. Yeah-- no, I'd let the next shift talk to you, kick you out, or whatever. You wouldn't grab me or anything? You're not gonna mess up my weekend with this, are you? I wasn't planning on it, but I'm not completely against it either. See, if you get all crazy, then I gotta write up a report and stuff. I'm here till 5:00, 5:30 easy, and I have a second job to get to-- the video store. Oh, that's where I-- I've seen you in there. You helped me once, I think. Yeah? With what? The Picture Of Dorian Gray. You found it in \"Drama,\" not \"Classics.\" Right! I remember that! Somebody misplaced it. Yes! Yeah, behind Cabaret. Mmm. That's funny. Anyway, you helped me. That was... nice. Thanks. But you're not gonna return the favor, right? You mean, step back over-- No, I-I'm-- I'm sorry. I can't. Why is that? It's a pretty good-sized sculpture. You could see it just fine from here. Truthfully? I'm gonna deface the statue. Oh. Uh, is that paint? Yes, it is.Great. Hey, uh, paint's not really a great thing to bring into a museum. Why do you have that? I'm gonna do something to the nude.What, like, color it? I'm thinking more of painting a big dick on it.Oh. And would \"Why?\" Be completely out of the question here? - Because I don't like art that isn't true. - True? This sculpture, it's fake, it's not real. Therefore, false art. No, it's a Fornicelli. It definitely is. I read the little thingie there one time. Yes, but the leaf isn't. It's not? Well, what is it? A pastie or something, like strippers have? It's plaster... that was added by a committee who had complaints from local townspeople. Really? I didn't know that. They took issue with his thing- you know, the shape of it. Said it was too lifelike. It's supposed to be God. You know, that's what pisses them off. Look. See, it's right behind the leaf there. You can just see his-- Twig. Yeah, but they didn't even cover it properly. It's shoddy craftsmanship. I mean, if you're gonna do it, at least do it--Exactly. Do it right. So, you're a student, then, or is this just basic anarchy? Student.Me too. What's your emphasis?Taking out school loans, mostly. But I do sit in on a few English classes. You're in art?Mm-hmm. MFA. Oh.Applied theory and crit. So, is this, like, a project, then, or-- No, I am just getting started on my thesis project now. It's a big sort of installation... thingie. That's a good word, huh? \"Thingie.\" It is. Anyway, this is just... an idea I had. You're cute. I don't like your hair. Thanks... I think. No, you're definitely cute, but you should-- you should do something with it, your hair. Okay. I-I'll try that. Your relief's late.Yeah. Typical. Yeah, so do you have to stay at your station until they spell you, or-- Oh, no, no. At punch-out time I'm supposed to get down there and do it. They can really be pricks about that. Oh, you should go, then. Yeah. Can I call you? What do you want to call me? Um... just up... For right now. I mean, talk. Maybe get crazy. Um, take you to dinner? Okay. Uh, sure. Do they... allow you to do that here? What, eat dinner? I meant, hit on the patrons. Uh, no. They've got a pretty strict policy about that too actually. But-- Ah. The Great Equalizer. \"But.\" Exactly. I'll take the risk. Good answer, Grasshopper. What? Kung fu. On TV? Remember when he was a kid, there was an old guy with fakey contact lenses-- Right! Grasshopper. I don't really watch much television. Yeah. So, do you want a number? Hmm? Oh, God. Absolutely. Oh, dang it. I don't have a pen. Me either. Here. What? Give me the jacket. Hmm? Oh. Uh-- Uh-- That's my own. That's not part of the uniform. That's mine. Good. Now you'll always have it on you. 6-3-0-- Great. Yeah. - So, I'll call you? - Yeah. It was nice to meet you... again. You too. You can definitely tell. You can. - Really. - I bet your friends say something. Twenty bucks. Okay. I mean, I can't tell, so I figured-- That's because you see you every day, shower, getting dressed-- - So do you. - I don't see you shower or getting dressed. I meant every day. So far, anyways. I know. I'm kidding. Oh. I'd like that, though, if... you would. What? Showering and... getting dressed, you know-- Both, if you want. Either. Anything. Any moment I can get with you. That's what I'd like. Ask and you shall receive. So I'm asking, then. So you shall be receiving, then. PDA.What? Public display of affection.Oh. I don't mind.Really? Nah. Whose business is it? Ours, right? Kiss if we want to. Make love in a bathroom stall. Who cares? I'd start with the administration. Why should they? We're two adults. We know what we're doing. I think this is a bigger discussion than before Jenny and Philip get here. Whatever.Oh, no, I mean-- I'd love to have it with you-- uh, the discussion. And I agree... somewhat.I understand. No, another time we'll definitely discuss it. \"Another time.\" I'd rather do it. We'll, let me go check the men's room. You amaze me. And you amaze me. You do. Look at you. It's just a little jogging. I'm very proud of you. Thank you... Henry Higgins. What's that? That's from a boo. Well, it's a play actually. Not the one we're seeing, though, is it? No, we're... seeing Medea. Oh, yeah, right. I read this as an undergrad. I like it. Should I be nervous? No, not too much. I mean, unless we have kids. Now, what about you? What about me? I don't know anything about you. Yes, you do. I don't. Not really. - Where am I from? - Illinois, near Chicago. - Sign. - Gemini, I think. - The twins, yes. - Does that mean that you have a split personality? No, it means I was born in June. Ah. Okay. Anything else you wanna know? Why do you like me? - What? - Why would you like me? I'm not anything. I mean-- Don't do that, okay? That's the only thing about you I don't like. What you see in yourself or don't see. Fuckin' insecurities. Sorry. Do you like me?Of course. And do I appear to like you? Huh?Yeah. I mean, it seems like it, yes.I dolike you. Do I seem to know my own mind?No question. So don't you trust me, then, to know how I feel?Yeah-- No, you're right-- I mean, don't worry about \"Why...\" When... \"What\" is right in front of you. Those are very wise words... from someone with such a great ass. Kiss me... Grasshopper. Ah-ah-ah! PDA. I don't think anybody wants to watch you kiss, Adam. Hi, guys. Hey, Phil. Hello. Hi.Hey! Evelyn, this is Philip. Hello.Hi. And his fiancée, Jenny. Hi.Hey. So, should we grab our tickets? Adam, what's up with you? Did you lose weight? Um... a little, maybe. No, it's-- he cut his hair or something. That's it, right?Right. Yeah, well, uh, both, sort of. Huh. Okay, so, let's, uh-- come on. Oh. ♪ Come on. So tell me this again. You guys are gonna--Underwater. We're gonna get married underwater. You gotta be kidding me.Like in those Lifemagazine photos you see, or whatever. Is that, like, a... California thing? No. We wanted to try something bold. That oughta do it. That is crazy. Really. So if we want to attend, we have to-- Get in the tank with us. You bet. - No. Honey, I thought we said the guests-- - Uh, we haven't-- We haven't settled that part completely. Yeah, well, don't expect my buddy here to follow in our footsteps. He's the least adventurous person I know. Really? Absolutely. Oh, and the marriage thing? Uh-uh. It's not gonna happen. Sorry. I don't know how many nights I listened to this guy say, \"Not me, man. I'm never gettin' hooked. No way, man.\" Well, well!Listen, don't encourage him. My roomie doesn't need any more encouragement. Formerroommate. You're gonna look stupid in one of those wet suits. - Hey, let's not be a party pooper, my friend. This could have been yours. Oh, Phil, stop being-- Adam and I had a class together, and he never got up the nerve to ask me out. I'm borrowing his pen, like, all the time-- hint, hint-- And he's this total monk the whole semester. Anyway, Phil picks him up from class one day, sees me, and we went to mini golf that same night. I cannot tell a lie. I got the moves, God help me. Whoo!God help all of us. Well, like I said, I think it's great. It's really amazing-- It is-- To find anybody willing to take a risk these days, to look a little silly or different or anything. Bravo. To people with balls. To balls. Long may they wave. I'll tell you what took some balls. That museum thing a few weeks back, with the balls. Did you guys read about that? Oh, Adam, of course you did. You were supposed to be guarding it. But, uh-- Evelyn, did you hear about it? - The penis. - Yes, I did. Why are we whispering? Because you don't say \"penis\" In Jenny's house. But we're at my place now, so we sing it from the eaves. ♪ Penis, penis ♪ Bar's closed. Last call. - ♪ Penis, penis ♪ - Nice. Seriously, though, can you believe that shit? Somebody with the gall to pull that kind of bullshit on our campus? Fuckin' burns me up. Shh. I'm an artist, so... maybe we should--I don't really have the same reaction as-- I mean, this isn't Berkeley. What does that mean anyway-- \"I'm an artist\"? Mmm, nothing. It means nothing really. Just that I understand the impulse. You what? Um, Evelyn, we should probably-- No, no. Wait, Adam. I wanna hear. What impulse? It's called vandalism. Uh, does anybody want dessert? Hold on. This is rich. Go ahead. Just that, um, I don't think it was just kids playing. I think it was a sort of statement, a kind of-- - Statement? - Yeah, I do. What kind of statement would that be? It was pornography. - Oh, no, it wasn't. - Yes, it was. No. Pornography is meant to titillate, to excite you. - Did you see a picture of what happened? - We did, yeah. And does a penis excite you? I mean, just any old penis? Uh, you're funny, and that's not the point. It's totally the point! How about you, Jenn? Did you like what you saw? Did it get you hot? This is, like, uncalled for, okay? - All she said was-- - I know what she said. Why don't you let her speak? Did you wanna say anything else? Huh? Okay. Then, look, all I'm-- I'm saying is that, in my opinion, it wasn't pornography, it was a statement. Wow. The postgraduate mind at work. You know, I still don't see how that makes it a statement. - What do you mean? - It's graffiti. It would be a huge statement, especially for a town like this. Which \"Take back the night\" rally did you find her at, Adam? You're really the obnoxious type. You know that? I mean, how long did you have to stomach this guy?Evelyn-- Anyhow, who knows what the person was saying by it. We don't. But I think it was a gesture, a kind of manifesto, if you will-- W-w-wait. I don't think a person's dick can be a manifesto. Uh-Uh. You can write a manifesto on your thing, but your thing can't be one. I'm sure I read that somewhere. See, you're just trying to be really-- Hey, I'm not trying to be anything. Who the hell do you think you are? A few double dates, and telling me anything about who I am. - Un-fucking-believable! - Okay, this is getting a little-- Adam, you can really pick 'em.Let's just forget the whole-- You are notgonna take his side in this, are you?No. Jesus!I'm just trying to get out of here with a touch of dignity. I've got a test tomorrow anyway.\"Statement.\" Just shut the fuck up! Fuck right off. How would you know? I think she was making one. So, that's my opinion. Jenny, thanks for everything. Yeah, how'd you know it was a girl? I don't. I just said. It's a guess-- what it was, where it was placed. An educatedguess. Oh, you're not-- She's not trying to take a poke at my being an undergrad, is she? Okay, can we just stop this now, please?Adam, tell me she didn't just-- Hey, artiste, how did you know it was a woman who painted the cock? Very, very suspicious there. You're such a prick. Man, how do you go on day after day? Let's go. Adam, are you coming? Yeah. I'll meet you out front? I just wanna--Okay. You're very sweet. Good luck. \"Good luck\"? Hey, fuck you! Oh, come on, M-Man! Where in hell did you meet that bitch?At the museum. What, did she give you a haircut and a blow job, now you're her puppy? Phil! I'm not her puppy! The wedding sounds great. Really, it sounds-- Yeah. You don't have to leave. Were you... always like this before? So... you know. Shy?Mm-hmm. Just about the fact that no one would ever sleep with me. That's all. Come on!No, seriously. I mean, you're, like, I don't know, only the third person I've ever-- Really?Yeah. I mean it. And they were both young. I mean, I was too. I wasn't, like, hanging out by a day care or anything. It was during high school, mostly. Hmm.So you're sort of in uncharted waters here. I don't wanna blow your cover, but... I could kinda tell. Yeah? Yeah. Well, nothing serious. Dates. Some close calls. But not anyone, you know-- Like Jenny?No, no. Are you sorry you didn't ask her out? Hmm? I mean, if-- If I wasn't in the equation. Not really. Hmm. We just never got the right-- What-- I sort of blew that one. Anyway, it's kinda weird talking about it now that-- That's okay. You know, it's nice to see, every so often, someone... gallant. So, did you enjoy tonight? Uh-huh. Dinner was great. The trip into the city-- That was fun. I like your car. I meant the performance. Oh, right, that. Um-- Not really. Well... that's all right. That's fine.Oh, no, it's not that I didn't enjoy it. It was okay. You didn't think it was amazing? I thought it was amazing that the cops didn't bust in and stop her. Oh, come on! How could you not find that moving, what she was doing? Easy. I mean, granted, I usually love it when a woman removes her tampon in front of me. - Very sexy. - It's not supposed to be sexy. I was joking. You know that. I mean, Jesus, it's an expression of herself as an artist, as a woman, a person. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Me either. You didn't get it. That's all. No, that's not true. We just don't agree. That's all. - I wanted to like it. - Then why didn't you? Maybe because she was finger painting portraits of her daddy using menstrual blood. She... is completely influential, totally vanguard. To me, it was nasty, it was private, and I felt like it was something I wasn't supposed to be seeing. She allowedyou to though. She allowed you into her world, into her work, but in a highly theatrical way. Exactly my point. It's called theater, not therapy. No, it's called performance art! - It's called her period! - It's called your taste up your ass! Did we just have our first fight? I think so. Yeah, we did. Cool. Better mark it down in our diaries. Yeah. Hey. We can do that-- fight. That's good. Why good? 'Cause, uh, now we get to make up. Were you nervous before? I mean, about us with the video. Oh, not really. A bit.Sure. Yeah. It's just, let's not watch it. Okay? Do we have to do that? Not if you don't want to.Good. I think everyone should see themselves doing it, and their friends should see it too. That's why the tape's going back to my place.Don't be so frightened. I'm not. I'm not frightened anyway. I just don't think that's a thing other people need to see, ever-- my ass. People like who? Philip? No, that's fine. You can show him. Are you crazy? Why is he your friend?Oh, God, you don't wanna go over all that. I just don't think you need that kind of person in your life. I mean, no one does. It-- it may be a touch early to start dictating who my friends are. Yeah... I suppose. Boy, he really got under your skin, didn't he? Under, over, around. I hate that kind of guy. What kind?That kind. Whatever he is, that's what I hate.I'll let him know. No! God, no. Don't give him the satisfaction. And he'd take it too. Believe me.I don't know. Maybe it would help him, you know, be better or something. The only thing that would help him is a fuckin' knife through his throat. Okay, I'm glad I don't have a pet rabbit or anything. You know what I mean. Um... no, not really. I've just been around his type, that's all, and I don't like him. Right. No, it was the \"Knife through the throat\" part that was the big deal, I thought. Oh, that's just an expression. From where? Transylvania? No. From the Scorned Girl's Handbook. Oh, yeah, page 666. You've been peeking. You know what happens to peekers, don't you? If they're deejays, they usually get asked to play \"Misty\" on the radio all the time. Close. No, I'll show you. But you have to do me a favor.What's that? Just... smile. Smile into the camera... for as... long as you can. Jenny! Adam! Hi! Hey. Hi. Oh!So-- Thanks for coming. I appreciate it. Of course. How's it going? You know... okay. Right. Lots to do for a wedding.I bet. Yeah. Invitations to get out, arrangements to make. Air tanks to fill. That too. - So you guys are still going through with that, huh? - That's what we're saying. - What do you mean, \"Saying\"? - No, no, no. We are. It's what we're doing. I just-- - Jenny, what? - I don't know. I'm just, you know, worried. Why? About what? What do you think? Philip. He's just, I don't know, being funny. - Funny how? - Just kinda funny odd. Like nice. Nice? Yeah. You know, sweet? Now, I love him and all. I do. You know that. But that is not the way I would describe him to people-- sweet. Would you? I wouldn't exactly use his name and \"Sweet\" in the same... short story. And that's what's bugging me. I mean, he's only been like this once before, maybe twice. But definitely once, when we were first going out and he was seeing somebody else. You remember that? Yeah. I do. The other one. The other Jenny. Exactly. I'd call and I could hear him freeze up, you know, get all sort of...sweet, fish around slowly until he figured out if it was her or me. God, I used to hate that. Maybe I'm just making it all up, you know? I mean, my own insecurities and looking for a reason to not-- Dive in? - Take the plunge? - Oh, God! Jump off the deep end? Stop me before I-- Cute, but yes. That might be it, but I don't think so. I mean, I wanna get married. I do. Even if it is underwater. And I love the guy, whether he's sweet or not. It's just, I don't believe him now that he is. Well, you got me. Really? I mean, you don't know anything? Haven't felt that? I only see him, like, once a week in our survey course, so it's not like I'm in the inner circle anymore.I know. I just thought that maybe you'd tell me if you knew something. But I would tell you, Jenny. I would. Seriously. Really?I think so. I mean-- oh, look, that's a lousy thing to pass on to a person. And if I did, you know, know something and then told you, you'd more likely hate me forever than be grateful. Yeah, that's probably true. Um, you could lie. Feel free. No, you're probably right.So that doesn't exactly make me want to come clean here. Which I have nothing to come clean about, okay? Honestly. It's just-- I-I just feel that I would. I-I do. Because I think you're pretty amazing... if the, uh, truth be know. And you're almost married, so why shouldn't it be? Uh, the truth, I mean. Thank you. Not a problem. Anyway, that's all I know. Which is nothing.Okay! Hwah! I'm just being stupid. Hey. If you feel it, it's not stupid. God! You're a lovely person. You know that? \"Lovely\"? Jesus, why don't you just call me gay and get it over with? Hey! Lovely is nice. No, I wish there were a few more lovely people in the world. I mean it. You are. And getting cuter by the day. What is that girl doing to you? Lots. She's amazing. Really. What happened to your glasses? Are you wearing-- No! Adam! Are those contacts?Yep. Contacts. Oh, my God. This from the former tape-around-the-nose-thingie champion. That was only for, like, a week! That one time! I know, but still, you gotta admit-- I do. It's great. I feel better. \"Better.\" I mean, you're, like, this totally hot guy now. I didn't think you'd go in for the makeover thingie. Me either. Who knew? Well, apparently she did. You are still seeing her, aren't you? Oh, yeah, She's-- You don't hold a grudge, do ya? All she said that night-- No, truthfully, it was. I mean, Phil needed to hear every word of that. He did too. Hear it, I mean. You know, he even said something after you guys left. I mean, not an admittance of guilt, exactly, but as close to one as we're likely to hear from the guy. He put on quite the show.I remember vaguely. They both did. Later on he said something like, \"He could do worse.\" Not exactly a seal of approval. No, but a lot for him. And after what she said? You're right. Huh. Hey, her middle name's not Jenny or anything, is it? No such luck. Whew! No, it's Ann. Evelyn Ann Thompson. It's nice, right? Eat? What? Eat. Those are her initials. The acronym of her name is E-A-T. Hey, that's cute.Oh, God, you're a goner. I know. It's pathetic, isn't it? Somewhat. But lovely. No, not that again! What the heck is this? What is this?What? Did you stop biting your nails?Yeah, for, like, a month now. Don't tell me she--It's true. She gave me some kind of crap to put on 'em, and that was it. I just stopped. You have nails! This is crazy! It's no biggie. The whole time I've known you-- Three years now-- Your fingers have looked like raw meat. Anyway, awful. And now you just quit. This girl is a messiah. I've quit before.For, like, an hour. I love this woman. Me too. Yeah, I can see that. Wow. And you'd really tell me if you knew something? I would, yes.Okay. Geez, when did you get so cute? Whew. Shit. Yeah. - What was that all about? Uh, I'm not sure. Look, I'm sorry. No. Don't be. I am. Uh, I'm the one with the ring on. Yeah, it's... my friend's ring. Good point. Thanks for reminding me. You're welcome. Aw, dang it! Oh, no, listen, it wasn't because of, you know, my worries or whatever, how I'm feeling about Philip right now. It wasn't.Okay. It just--Happened. Right. I've wanted to do that for a long time. Three years. Me too. Now we take it down to the-- The beach and bury it. Don't we? Yeah, we do. Of course. Um... don't you want to? Bury it? Yes. Or-- No. No, we can't talk about it. Don't even say the-- God. Do you have a shovel in your car? Uh, I don't, no. But... I have my car. My bike's right over there. Then it... should be fine if we were to... go to the beach. I suppose so. Good. Oh, come on. We should go bury this. On the beach. ♪ Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Oooh, ooh-Ooh-Ooh, ooh-ooh-h ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ What time did they say? 10:30.It's 10:50 now. No big deal. You always wait at the doctor's office. I know. I just had to be at work by 12:00. Today? Yeah, I told you that. No, you didn't.Yeah, I did. I always work Wednesdays. Really?Yeah. Every Wednesday. Hmm.It's okay. I can be late if I have to. Are you sure?Yeah. I mean, they hate it, but I'll come up with something. I wanna do this. I do. I mean, w-who wouldn't want to pay a lot of money to get their nose chopped off? Well, you're only talking to them anyway. That's all. It's just weird to think-- People do it all the time. Especially out here. Right. No, you're right. You're right. - I just never imagined myself to be one of those people. - I'm one of those people. What? You are not. Take a look. Where? I don't see anything.Exactly. You got your nose done? Honestly? Sixteen. My parent'' birthday present. Thoughtful.I asked for it. I had this terrible hook. The Jewish slope, we called it in Lake Forest. The only ski run for miles around. I can't believe it. I can't tell.That's the idea, isn't it? You could be lying to me.What would be the point of that? To get me in here. To watch chunks of my flesh get torn away. You could be a sadist for all I know.Hey, quit sweet-talking me. God, they did an amazing job. Mmm. Wait a minute. Your name's Thompson. That's not Jewish. On my mother's side, you dope. That's what makes me Jewish. Her maiden name is Tessman. Oh. We don't have to stay here, Adam. No, it's okay. It just makes me jumpy. It's cosmetic, not corrective. Lots of guys do it. It's no big deal. I promise. Well, if it's cosmetic, maybe I should just put some powder on it. You know, I think you'll look great. You have a good face. A nice shape to your nose, actually, but it's just got that bit of-- What? Bulb. At the end. I mean-- well, not a bulb exactly, but more of a-- No, I get it. Sort of a Rudolph effect. Shall I go check the men's room? - I dare you. - Shut up. I'm serious. Is this, like, my last Mel or something? A conjugal visit before I'm drawn and quartered? Stop being so morbid. It's just flesh. Yeah, I see what you mean. It's just flesh. That's not morbid at all.It isn't. You've bitten more skin off from around your fingernails... than a doctor would ever trim off your nose. It's true. How'd you get that scar on your back? Which? The--Yes, the raised one. A kid, um, threw a stick at me, first grade. Stitches?Yeah. Thirty-three. And is that terrible? Are you disfigured because of it? Well... I don't like to wear tank tops. What's the matter with scars? Not a thing. Did you try to-- No. Not really. I mean, I cut on myself a little, tried to get attention when I was a teenager, but I didn't wanna slit my veins open. So, is my arm unattractive to you then because of those, or not? No, not at all. I love your arm. It's beautiful. They're like rings on a tree. They signify experience, make us unique. I can see that.And that's all this is. The idea of you having some surgery. It's an experience. I know. It just makes me-- What? Nervous? \"It's a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done.\" Something like that. Is that from a book? Yeah. Dickens. Ah! So... are you gonna go check? What? What, the restroom?Uh-huh. What if they call my name though? Seriously. What if they do? I smell trouble...mmm. Which I may not be able to do after this. Just go.All right. Then I can show you something.What? Hmm? Oh, nothin'. No, uh, just a little something I had done... for you. Wait. No. Show me now. It's a big religious no-no. Nice, huh?\"Eat.\" Let me guess. You couldn't afford the \"Me.\" No, you goof. It's your initials. Do you like it? I do. I like it. I'm serious. It looks good. Just shut up. Don't get here late and then make fun of me. - No. You look distinguished. - Phil. I look like a hockey player. Yeah, but a distinguished one. What'd you do anyway? I fell. Come on. What? Seriously. I did. You sound like a battered wife. I fell.That's not funny. Yeah, it is. It's very funny. I mean, it's not that funny that wives get beat up, but the fact that you look like one-- that I find hilarious. Well, that's what happened. I tripped, I fell. No big deal. You really fell?Yeah. I, uh, tripped going up the-- You know? No. What? The... thingie. I hit the edge of the-- The edge of the knob-- My doorknob. You really tripped? Truthfully?Yes. God. Huh. Okay. Why do you say that-- \"Huh\"? - What, you don't believe me? - No. I just-- I saw your girlfriend the other day, maybe what, last Thursday. You weren't in class. I asked her if you were okay. That's all. Yeah? So? And she said yes, but you were recovering from an operationor something. What? That's what I said. Then she said it wasn't really an operation, per se, just some thingyou had done-- a \"procedure.\" That was it. So I just thought, no. I don't know, whatever. I-I hurt it. Really. I hit it-- you know, I banged it up pretty bad at home. So I had the doctor take a look at it, but he didn't operate or anything. So where'd you see her? I don't know. Starbucks or somewhere-- The mall maybe. She doesn't drink coffee. So it was downtown then. Record City, I think. Wh-what, you worried I'm gonna steal her? No. God. Don't be so-- Believe me. - Ugh! - Anyway, it's gonna be fine. Well, that's good to hear. Yeah. And, uh, you'd tell me if there was anything seriously wrong. Of course. Hey, what's up? I mean, we're friends, right? You'd come to me.About what? - Phil, what's-- - Jenny told me. Jenny told you what? She kissed you. - Oh. - She felt shitty, I guess. I could tell for, like, a week somethin' was goin' on. And then finally she told me about it. She did. I mean, she did do that, but it-it was nothing. No. I don't mean nothing, no. Uh, it meant nothing. It didn't hold any meaning for us. For \"us\"? Okay, so you can speak for her then? It just happened. For me. It didn't for me. It was just a-- And that's all she said? - Don't tell me there's more. - No. God, no, not at all. No. It's all right. I'd been acting weird lately. This whole... marriage idea is just freaky, so-- It's my fault, I guess. Sorry. It's better than me having to kiss you. - Good point. - No tongue, right? - Oh, Jesus! - I'm just asking. No. Please. Well, I got a 3:10. So long, Romeo. Where's your jacket? What? Okay, this is, uh... too much. The cord jacket? The lumberjacky-lookin' thing? I don't know.Uh-Huh. And this, uh, Tommy Hilfiger-ish job-- Where'd you come up with that?The mall. I bought it. - What's the big deal? - That's, like, a sailing slicker. She likes it. It's reversible. Well, isn't that just neat? What I want to know is, do youlike it? It's okay. Uh-huh. Let me ask you this. Did you get to keep the cord job, or did she make you toss it? - Who cares? God-- - Huh? I threw it out, okay? Goodwill, actually. \"Goodwill, actually.\"It's no big thing. Dude, don't just say \"No big thing.\" I begged you to throw out the farm coat our freshman year. I mean, you lost both of us a lot of dates with that thing on, okay? You've had it since, like, birth. All right? So do me a little favor. Let's not pretend that the jackie and the, uh, weight... Ow! And the Jon Bon Jovi hair are no big thing.Ow! Don't! 'cause when it comes to routine, you used to be, like, Mister Goddamn Rogers. It's a fuckin' jacket, Phil! Just lay off. Go to class. Uh-huh, fine.Fine. I just hope the next time we pass each other, I recognize who the hell you are. Oh, yeah? Well, if not, you and Evelyn can always head over to Record City and have a chat. Hey! I wouldn't get too deep into the moral issues during this particular conversation. Okay, Romeo? I may have a big fucking mouth, but at least I keep it to myself. Oh! My-- Oh, is it time to go? Uh-huh? Fine. So long,matey! Ow! You've got my fuckin' bag! Dude! Seriously, I've got class! ♪ Oh ♪ So, everything's good?Yeah. You know, okay. Hmm.You? Oh, pretty great, actually. Just studying, working on my art. Right. You've got that big thing that you're doing.Mm. Thesis project for my degree. And it's going well?Yeah. What was it again?I never said. Oh. Well, that's why. Right. It's this sculpture... thingie. Nice. I think what you've done with Adam-- It's really great. What I'vedone?Well, just, you know, he's changed. That's right. He'schanged.Of course. I didn't mean that you-- I know. I'm just saying, he did the work.Right. Well, that's always what they say, though, isn't it? What? Who are \"They\"?You know, like in Cosmo, when they have those tests asking you what you'd like to change about your guy. Ah, now you're gonna get all scientific on me. It's true, though, isn't it? I mean, almost everyone I've ever gone out with, if you could alter just one thing about them or... even to get them to stop wearing sunglasses up on their head all the time, then they'd be perfect. - Well, it's that sort of deal, isn't it? - Something like that. Or it could just be that I care about him. Hmm. Well, Phil's got, like, six of those \"One things,\" but it's the same idea. Right. And how is old Phil? Well, he's Phil-- Six things away from being amazing. Hey. - Hey, Evelyn. - Adam. Hi. Jenny. I didn't know that you-- I invited her. Oh. Uh-- I like your new jacket. Phil told me about it. Oh, yeah. It's, uh, new. And your nose-- My God, are you okay? Of course. It was nothin'. Falling down is not nothing. It looks okay though. - Anyway, uh-- - Anyway, pull up some floor. We... got you a juice. You don't drink coffee.It's not. It's decaf. It's still coffee.Good point. So I drink coffee. Then I just don't like the caffeine. Mm. Jenny was just saying that she thinks you're great. I mean, doing great things with yourself. Yeah? Thanks, Jenny.She thinks you're just about perfect now. Don't you, Jenn?I didn't say that. No. It's true. I'm exaggerating. She said-- and I paraphrase-- \"He's changed,\" but she implied for the better. Oh. Well, I agree. I have. And again, thank you.You're welcome. I think you've changed too, Adam. A lot. Yeah? How's that? Well, you've gotten cuter... and stronger, more confident and, um... craftier. Craftier, huh?Apparently so. Oh, that spill you took must have done it. I'm sorry. Am I missing something here? I'm not sure. Evelyn, what's up? Nothing. Not a thing. Well, sometimes it's hard to read me, you know, know when I'm joking. Very hard.It is, but I am... joking. I mean, Adam took a bad fall and smashed his nose, but he's okay now. See? It healed well, don't you think? Yes.Uh, do you guys want a salad or something? I'm hungry.I'm fine. Jenny? I'm okay.Hungry? Your nose looks-- How much weight have you lost? Not that much really. Twenty-one pounds. I peeked. Is that all right? - \"Peeked\"? - His journal-- a record of his progress that he's keeping. Really? Oh, that's so cool. - Cosmo story in the making, huh? - Yeah. Okay, I'm, like, totally lost here. You're mentioned in there too, Jenny. Where? Adam's journal. I mean, it's a veiled entry, but I think it's you. Evelyn. I peeked twice. You're right next to someone known as \"Cute waitress.\" Why is that? - I mean, Adam? - You're not. Something about a meeting and a drive... - In your cute little \"V-dub.\" - What are you saying? - It's getting pretty late. I need to get go-- - Why are you doing this? I just want to talk about the kiss. Why can't we do that? This is inappropriate, okay? Did you tell her? No. No, no. He didn't. Philip did. We met, and he told me all about it. The rest I got from lover boy's diary. She's making that up. Wait. Philip told you about our talk? When? What else did he tell you?Lots of things. He's a very chatty guy when you... wind him up. I can't believe it.Evelyn, let's just drop it, okay? - If you're angry with me, all right, but this is not-- - We're just talking. Fine. You wanna-- Go ahead. - I mean, Adam wrote something in his journal, obviously. - I didn't! What do you wanna hear? We kissed. No. No, no. I-- I knew that. I'm sorry. I've confused you. I meant about my kiss... with Philip. - What? - That's bullshit. No. That's getting even. Unless you guys have something else you want to tell me about-- Meaning the drive. You didn't meet Phil. Ask him. - He would have told me. - Apparently not. I'm going. I'm going now, okay? I'll, uh, see you. You guys are still coming to my showing, right? Well... you said you would. Okay. That was horrible. Oh, I don't know. I could've told her about the blow job I gave him. Kidding. You had no right to make her feel that way. She's got a boyfriend who's shit. Now she knows. It was still wrong to treat her like that. And me. Yeah, let's talk about you. She called me, okay? She wanted to get together and, you know, talk about Phil, and then-- And then you made out. Most natural thing in the world. It was a mistake, okay? I know that. I just want the truth. I told you what I did. You think I wanted to kiss that guy? I only did it for the effect. I'm asking you, Adam. What else happened? I deserve to know. Nothing. You're sticking with that? Oh, and glad to hear about your trip. - See you next fall. - What was I supposed to tell him? - The truth! - Wh-- Come on. Look, I took shit about my new jacket. That's all people say to me anymore. \"What's up with you?\" \"What's goin' on?\" I can't exactly spread it around what I've done.What? You fell. What are we doing here? Are you tired of me? Is that it? God, no! I don't get it. I don't want to sound old-fashioned here, but... you're a step away from fuckin' around on me.I would never do that. If it hadn't been her, if it'd have been... oh, say, that cute waitress the other night. You didn't think I caught that, did you? The chatty chat and the extra three bucks on the tip. That was nothing. It's never anything... until it's something. Geez! Next you're gonna tell me the handkerchief with the strawberries on it is missing. I don't know that reference. Evelyn, please. Evelyn. I'll do anything you want. I know what I did was wrong. I do. I messed up. So just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. I just-- I don't-- I don't wanna lose you. - You're sure? - I am so sure. I love you. Anything I say? Anything. Give them up... as friends, both of them. Huh? No explanation. Don't see them or speak to them again, not ever. That's what I want. That's to prove to me about how you feel. - And if I don't? - Well, um, I pretty much let these things end. Final answer? I choose you. You choose well... Grasshopper. Adam. - Ahoy. - Phil. How's it goin'? So... what, you don't take my calls now? What? No, I-- It's all right. I understand. The whole... Thing. - I've just been busy with work and all. Yeah, whatever. - Well, I should probably grab a seat. - Hold up. Hey. Where's the fire? What? No. I-- No. I just want a... good spot and-- So, where's Jenny? Funny. What? Man, come on. We broke up, broke it off-- Whatever. You knew that. No. I-- When? Like, two weeks ago, right after-- You know. You and Jenny-- I can't believe that. Believe it. She came over one day after seeing you guys, I guess. That was it-- the ring off, took her cd's back-- gone. I'm sorry. I mean, I was lookin' to get out. You know that. But once you start makin' those plans, you know-- like pickin' out napkins and shit-- It's almost easier to just do the thing. - I don't know what to say. - Don't worry about it. You haven't seen her lately, have you? - No. - Okay. Well, this ought to be good, huh? Jenny. - Adam. - Hey. - Hi, Phil. I'm sorry... about you guys. Boy, you just can't keep anything to yourself, can you? Well, every so often, I guess. Right? What? You never change. That's what. - Oh, and, Phil? - Yeah? You don't really need sunglasses indoors. - What is she-- - It's not, like, totally official yet. Fuck. What are you gonna do? - Well, we should probably find a place too. - Grab two close to the exit. Oh, maybe we shouldn't-- You know, Jenny and-- Whatever. Take care, man. Could I--Mm-hmm. Good afternoon. Thank you for coming out today. It's the middle of stop week, and I'm sure this is not... how most of you studying for finals... would choose to spend your time away from campus-- on campus. The accompanying visual portion of this graduate thesis project... is currently available in the exhibition gallery across the way, so if you don't stay today for... punch and cookies, um... please stop by and take a look at your... convenience. Okay, that's the boring stuff. Oh, I almost forgot. And this is fairly personal-- Probably shouldn't even do it-- But it really is the capper to my time here at mercy, so please indulge me. I was given an engagement ring... two days ago, and I haven't really answered the guy yet. So I wanted to do it today. Here goes. This is a beautiful stone... and an amazing gesture on your part... for many reasons. By the time I'm through here, I promise that you'll have your answer. My graduate advisor gave me this advice five months ago. \"Strive to make art, but change the world.\" And so, being a good little student, that's what I set out to do. With that in mind, I present you with my newest work. It is a human sculpture... on which I've worked these past 18 weeks... and of whom I am very proud. The piece itself is untitled, since I think-- I-I hope-- It will mean something different to each of you... and, frankly, anyone who sees it. Can I get a spot-- I did the MTV thing here on the face. This is a \"before\" picture that I had a classmate take of us... near the Pizza Hut out by the highway. That was our first official encounter... after he asked me out at his place of work-- A big no-no, or so I was told. And it was here that I coaxed him into eating his first vegetarian meal. Well, as vegetarian... as a spinach-and-mushroom calzone can be. He also had a salad. Anyway, he told me that, for him, it was a huge deal... and it does mark the beginning of my systematic makeover-- Or sculpting,if you will-- Of my two very pliable materials of choice-- The human flesh... and the human will. But this, I'm afraid, was not done out of love or caring... or concert. This was a simple matter of, \"Can I instill 'x' amount of change in this creature... using only manipulation as my palette knife?\" I made sure that nothing was ever forced... during our sessions or sittingstogether-- I-I can't really say they were dates, not on my part, although the illusion of dating was imperative-- And that his free will was at the forefront of each decision. I made suggestions, presented the illusion of interest and... desire, but never said, \"You must do this.\" Not once. Any questions yet? I found that with the right coaxing-- Yes, coaxing, often of a sexual nature and often in very public arenas, I'll admit-- I could hone the inside of my sculpture... as well as the surface. Now, I found myself... suddenly creating strong moral ambiguity... where I could detect only the slightest traces before, often in direct proportion to the amount of external change. This means, as my subject became handsomer... and firmer and more confident, his actions became more and more... um... questionable. Against medical advice, he had work done to his face... and insisted to those around him that he had... What? merely fallen down. He also started to deceive his friends-- and myself-- with greater abandon during this period... while showing increased interest in other women. Indeed, he had relations with his best friend's fiancée... and continues to withhold details about the incident from us... to this day. Moreover, he was willing to give those friends up when asked-- Walk away without any further contact... after said encounter-- Leading me to an assumption of further wrongdoing... with the young woman in question. This is fucked! I call this act morally questionable... because it seems to be motivated, in my mind at least, as much out of guilt as genuine feelings for me. He has then, as I see it, been completely... and totally refashioned as a person. And yet, open any fashion magazine, turn on any television program, and the world will tell you he's only gotten... more interesting, more desirable, more normal. In a word... better. He is a living, breathing example... of our obsession with the surface of things, the shape of them. Not bad, huh? This was a completely... startling and... unexpected turn of events, but... obviously, I can't accept. You can examine the stone and setting further... when it's placed in the exhibit. As for me, I have no regrets, no feelings of remorse for my actions, the manufactured emotions-- None of it. I have always stood by the single and simple conceit... that I am an artist, only that. There is... only art. Now, you may hold a different opinion, feel differently. I welcome that. Difference is good, great, vital even. Only indifference is suspect. Only to indifference do I say... Fuck you. With that in mind, I offer you my untitled sculpture... and supporting materials today. Thank you. Not a big modern art crowd, I guess, huh? Hey. Glad you stopped by. I can't really show my face in the streets, so it seemed logical. Look, Adam, I know that-- Please... just refer to me as \"It\".. or, uh, \"Untitled.\" It'll help me keep some perspective here. I know that this a lot for you to take in and everything, but I-- Uh-huh, yeah. I got a little Gregor Samsa thing goin' right now, so, uh-- I know my work relied on not telling you what was going on. Sorry. You're sorry. That's great. I figured I was really gonna have to work to get that one out of you. Oh, I'm not sorry, not for what I've done. I just feel bad that you're so upset. Screw you! You have screwed me, a lot. You wanna watch it? Just pull up a chair. Shit. You are seriously fucked up. I mean it. Listen to your mouth. You never used to talk like that. Oh, you're gonna take credit for that too, huh? No. You picked that up all on your own. Cute guys always have potty mouths. They think it makes them cuter. Oh, yeah? Tell me how cute this one is then. Fuck you! You heartless cunt. So tell me then. Go ahead. You feel that way about me. You can tell me what I did wrong. IfI did something wrong. You don't see this as wrong? You honestly have no concept here. If you hadn't been here today, hadn't heard all this stuff, wouldn't you still be happy-- Waiting at home for me, hoping this went well, wanting to make love? - That's not the point. - Yes, it is. It's the total point. All that stuff we did was real for you. Therefore, it was real. It wasn't for me. Therefore, it wasn't. It's all subjective, Adam-- everything. I'll tell you something real. I should sue your ass. You could try. I did take that risk. Yeah. That's right, you did. What's this doin' here? It was only four bucks at the goodwill. Why would you buy that? Just so I'd have it-- All of you. Fine. What the hell? It can't get any worse. If you get off on showing people my old socks... and scuzzy sheets, go for it. I don't \"Get off\" on it. This is my work, Adam. I'll give you back whatever you want as soon as I get my grade. The ring would be nice. It was my grandma's. I'll take care of it. Good. Hard feelings? Me? No. We had some fun, right? - Yeah. - Oh, but, hey, that's subjective. Exactly. But do me a favor? Don't fool yourself and think that this is art. Okay? It's a sick fuckin' joke, but it's not art. Is that right? Pretty much, yeah. And if I'm wrong about that-- I mean, if I've completely missed the point here, and somehow puking up... all your own shitty little neuroses all over people's laps is actually art, then you ought to at least realize there's a price to it all. Wow. Okay, so... you're saying... I should be a better person? I mean, is that it? That's the nutshell, yeah. Better like... you? No. Just better. Oh. Tell me, though, just one thing. Yes? Was any of it true? The, uh, nose job... or Lake Forest? Your mother's maiden name? One thing you ever said to me? No. And the scars are-- That was another project. I got it. Sorry. I should, uh, Probably get going. Are you coming? No, not yet. Don't worry. I'm not gonna mess up your stuff. No spray paint. That one time... in my bed one night when you leaned over.. and whispered in my ear-- remember? - And I whispered back to you. I said that I-- - I remember. I meant that. I did. - Yeah? - Yes.

      "Good evening, warden. I see your blood forth your closest ribs. You are about to become a non-person, Shadow. You have no idea how right you are. Fuck you! Shadow! Deliver us life! Edward Markeen, aka Shadow. Convicted of 22 counts of capital murder. Including four police officers. 12 counts of rape. 9 counts of double homicide. Mothers and unborn children. I waited a long time for this. It's time, Father. They were banished from among men. With an outcry like that against thief. To dwell on the slopes, the bodies in caves send stone. Love the bushes they raise, their eyes crying. Under the nettles they hurtle together. Irresponsible... devious... men. They retrieve it. Ouch. What happened? God has fled. Hell reigns. Darkness prevails! What a hell happened down there? What a fuck? That's the south block! Fire! SHADOW DEAD RIOT SHADOW KILLER AT LARGE 7th VICTIM OF SHADOW KILLER BIZARRE BLOOD RITUAL 3rd PREGNANT WOMAN FOUND DRAINED OF BLOOD. SHADOW KILLER CAUGHT DRINKING BLOOD OF EXPECTING MOTHERS FOR IMMORTALITY SHADOW KILLER SCHEDULED FOR LETHAL INJECTION 20 YEARS LATER ELLIS GLEN EXPERIMENTAL REHABILITATION FACILITY FOR WOMEN What's going on baby. I'll be seeing you later. Welcome to Ellis Glen. We have a small group of wonderful ladies here. We're not about punishment. Oh, no. We are about spiritual rehabilitation through physical improvement. A diet regimen and a work regimen. As you can see this place could use a little physical improvement itself. Work is good for the soul. It'll be good for yours. I understand you like to call yourself Solitaire. Don't try to go this alone. Do yourself a favour and help us help you. Take her to admitting. Well, you're gonna have to get used to this. It's a vitamin shot. It's part of Danvers health plan. You seem a little tense. Perhaps a little massage just might help you feel a little better. All right! All right, let me up! All right, we're finished here. For today... Looking good, honey! You must be Danvers new girl. I like to say she puts the hell in health. I'm Emily. But lately everyone's been calling me Preggers. I guess I should be grateful, right? Like Danvers all health thing. It's gotta be good for the baby. So what's your story? I heard them call you Solitaire, why is that? Because I prefer to be alone. It's gonna be tough around here. Around here it's all about the team spirit. And I'm sure they've already told you that. My Steve was a loner. They called him a murderer on the news but that's not who he is. He didn't mean to shoot that guy. He just panicked, that's all. All I did was drive the getaway car. I wonder how tough she really is. So why don't you take her on to find out? Then I won't have to kick your skinny little ass all the time. Hello! Soap. You! Yo, I'm fucking talking to you! You look like you got something to say. Don't you even look at her! You're standing there like you think that you're better than everybody else. Let me tell you something honey. Warden favoured you and you will get bad in here real quick. Finish! Hey, I'm Crystal. So cool to see a new face around here. You know especially somebody who's not afraid to stand up to Mondo. Just as long as she stays out of my way. I was thinking you know. If you need somebody for anything. I think I know that you don't like to talk much. But if you need somebody to talk to... I could be like your sister or something. Crystal, you need a big sister? She don't give a hell about you. I'm your big sister in here. You're gonna consider me? You're gonna misbehave anymore? Crystal, you misbe... Yes? Why don't you pick on someone my size? Okay, so she makes her move! I hope you don't think I'm gonna be scared just because you killed somebody. Maybe I'll make it two. Let me tell you something, I got four on you honey. And I'm not trying to bullshitting away like some justify or homicide. What do you know about me? Don't play me, I know everything about you! I see at you on the news, Solitaire. And let me ask you something, why the hell do you call yourself that anyway? Cause I don't play well with outers. Wow, wow, sweetheart. You will learn to be a team player. And right here is your first lesson on the house. Brigitte, Lina! Enough! I should have known! Perhaps we weren't properly introduced before. My name is Elsa Thorne but you can call me bitch behind my back. More than Danvers enforces the rules on the program, I enforce discipline! She believes in the strong mind, I believe in the strong first impression! You're gonna be handful. Maybe two handfuls. Your ass is in solitary for the day. Not a good way to get started here. - What about them? - They're coming too. Oh, bullshit! There will be a rematch. Don't sleep, Solitaire! Mother's blood. No! Bitch can't escape me! Rise and shine, ladies! It's a beautiful morning. The temperature is gorgeous 82 degrees. So up and at them. Everyone, in the showers! Shut the fuck up! This is gonna be fine. It's gonna heal in no time. Thank you. Good thing Solitaire is here. Could have been a lot worse. I mean she was so amazing. You should have seen her. Yeah, I wish I was there. I heard she fought them all at once? Yeah, all three of them. She totally held her own. - She was about to bash Mondo's face! - Listen, you just stay clear on Mondo, okay? I'll try. You know I'm not actually really worried about it anymore. Cause now Solitaire is here. Solitaire seems to be making quite an impression. Yeah, she kicked Mondo's ass real good. I know her little gang too. - Bearly broke a sweat. - Really? You got something for me or what? - Yeah. - Come on! Yeah, I can prescribe something for you. This is it? Sorry, it's the best I can do. Hey, you got something for me? Yeah, I got something for you. Solitaire? You know the only good thing about being pregnant in jail, is that they let you take extra food. You know, I wanted to come and tell you that I thought it was really cool what you did for Crystal today. Nobody ever stands up to Mondo like that. I wish I could but... You remind me of Steve like that, you know. Such a bad temper but really not that bad when you get to know them. I better get back before I get caught. So guess I'll see you later. Thanks. Come with me. - What? - Let's go. See how Mondo treats you? You're scared, aren't you? Yeah. I want to fight back but... Anyway now Solitaire is here, I don't think I got to worry about it anymore. Do not trust her. She's violent. Unpredictable. She could turn on you too. Why do you say that? Anyway, who's gonna protect me? I can look after you. I can make sure that Mondo and her girls leave you alone for good. But you have to be good to me too. Good to you? Now Crystal. It won't be that bad. You can ask Hotrod. She seems to really like it. - Now I have to like it too? - Oh, please don't be like that. You make it something awful. Look, who's hands would you rather have on you? Mine or Mondo's? Do what I ask and I promise Mondo will never touch you ever again. Elsa, this is not productive. We've spoken about this before. We're simply coming to an agreement. A mutually rewarding agreement. You are not taking advantage of any of this girls under my watch. Now they're here to follow a program, I want no distractions. I am taking advantage of no one. Nobody is being forced and nobody is being hurt. Isn't that right? You are not to have any more sessions with these girls. I don't want any more of them coming back damaged. Crystal! Call your guards! Nevermind, I'll do it myself. She's running across the restrictive yard. We have a prisoner in the restrictive area. All units report. We have a prisoner in the restrictive area. All units report. Yoga class will commense in 15 minutes for the green room. Please make your way down to the gym hall. I'm giving you a second chance. Please make the most of it. Despite what you might think, punishment is not one of my favourite things. Did you drug me somehow, Danvers? Mind does strange things in isolation. Especially the first time. Perhaps you've heard some rumors about the history of this place. But it would serve you to just let all that go and focus on your reality in the present. My mind doesn't play tricks on me, I know what I saw. Then do your best to avoid that womb, Solitaire. Like I said I don't believe in negative reinforcement. So help me by not earning it. Your temperature seems to be normal. Blood pressure is holding steady. I think Danvers is just being normally cautious. You are pretty good with those fists though. You get quite a reputation. I hear you gave Mondo a run for her mind. I just don't like seeing people taking advantage of. Humility is for the weak. There is strength in your blood, you shouldn't deny that. Are you my therapist now? Let's just say I think there's something very special about you. What's Danvers hiding? I wasn't aware Danvers was hiding anything. I saw blood on the walls! That blood is ancient history, it's been there forever. We're gonna take care of it as soon as possible. What happened in this place? I know just as much as you do. Get back up on the table. I'll give you vitamine injection. I'm a little freaked out about Crystal. Did you notice the way Danvers and Elsa are running around? Whispering and acting like nothing's wrong. This isn't the first time something heavy has hit this place. Yeah, I feel it too. Help! Guard help! Look at this. I have cut artery. Look at this, I'm bleeding! Hey, it's an artery! I'm fucking bleeding now, for this goddamn piece of shit! I didn't know Brigitte was such a crybaby. Don't stress her. You'll be crying next. Is this a rematch? - I wanna piece in this one too. - This is my fight! Go grow some balls. You're feeling froggy, leave. Are you all right? Stop it. What am I doing here? - The idea was for you to relax. - You shot me, you bitch! I was defending myself! - Where's Mondo? - Back in solitary. So are her girls and your friend Waco. Care to join them? I'm hoping emerging therapy will help you find peace. Peace? Peace of what? Lie back, Solitaire. Lie back and let the water surround you and calm you. Let yourself become detached from your rage. That's it. Lie back. Step outside yourself, Solitaire. Bathe. Overcome. - Who is he? - What do you mean? I saw him again. Evil. He was with my mother, he died in this room. Many men died in this room. None of them fucking exploded, that should never went down. It happened, I saw it. And I don't think he's left this place. Have you ever had a vision like this before? Any occurance of psychic ability? A little with my mother, but nothing like this. You will tell me what I need to know. - I wish I could help you. - You wish you had. Now how long is this gonna take? I can hurry, then you go right back to solitary. Don't get smart with me, doc. You know I will snap your neck like a fucking pencil and make it look like an accident! I'm sure you can. You are the strongest woman we have in here. Or that is you were until Solitaire... Slow you rule doc. We both know that she just got lucky. And if you don't stop flapping your gums, you're gonna be the next one taking a beat down. So many threats, Mondo. I think I'll have a little something to calm you down. Now you sound like the warden. She thinks she's smarter than me, smarter than everybody. And you know she thinks she's smarter than you. Well, she's definitely wrong about that. But just keep that in secret between the two of us, shall we? Yo, what the fuck is that black stuff? I already had my vitamines, I don't need any more. It's just a booster. After what happened this morning I thought maybe you could use a little something. Whatever. Just hurry up so I could get the hell out of here. Mondo? Mondo, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Mondo, can you hear me? What's happened in here? Oh, my God! She went crazy. I was treating her wounds and she flew into a rage. She killed Frank, I only tried to stop her. I'm sorry. I had to put her down. - You put her down all right. - I had to! You knew what she was like, how strong she was. I had no choice. Doctor Swann, I want you to dispose of these two bodies as descretely as possible. - Discretely? - Yes. If one of this gets out, this program is finished. First Crystal and now this. What is happening here? My work must continue and it will. Do your part, doctor Swann and leave the rest to me. You stay here. He'll need help cleaning this up. We haven't met, but we've been acquainted all of our lives. I'm sorry. The baby's kicking me good. - You want me to get you some help? - No, I'm fine. I just gotta relax. Get some damn positive energy. Guess it's the first time I heard you joke around here. Maybe Danvers' voodoo working on you. Yeah right, Danvers. - If it's anyone it's you. - Me? What do I have to do then? You remind me of somebody. You mean her? Someone took her from me. I never got to know her. You know, you are the only one in this place that doesn't seem like belonging here. I think you'd make a good mother if you could get out. What's the matter? - Emily. - I know. - I know, it's coming. - Jesus Christ. - It's not supposed to. - Hey! We need some help down here! - It's Emily, she's having a baby! - You have to help me. - Shut up! - I'm trying to sleep! Hey! I said she's having her baby right now! I said she's having a baby right now! Hey! I need help down here! Oh stop that banging! How you're doing? You're hanging in there? Come on baby, I'll be right back. You stay here and I'll go get help. I heard what happened. How are you feeling? Where's my baby? We've made arrangements for the baby. But we're no longer capable of taking care of you. For the time, I have no choice but to keep you secure. No. Please don't go. I regret to have to do this. I thought our first therapy generated some positive results. I have no choice now but to arrange for your transfer. Just when I was getting to know this place. I'm ready now. Show me! You have something that belongs to me. I don't have what you want anymore. Too late. - Too late. - Too late. You shouldn't lie to me. You know that. I can feel your heartbeat. I can feel blood running through your veins. You couldn't stop me from delivering her! Time is on my side. I found you. And I'll find her. Behind this... beauty... lies your destruction. What do you want? I need your help. They won't let me out to see my baby. Oh, you need my help. All of the sudden you need a pathetic junkie's help. Guess I can't call you Preggers anymore now, can I? I know what's your real name is. It's Emily. Do you know what my name is? - No. - No. No. You just judge me cause I have a certain relationship with a doc. And you figure that you can use me to get to your baby, isn't that right? You know I never do nothing to nobody except myself. - I certainly didn't kill anybody. - Neither did I! No, it was your loving boyfriend. I didn't know that he was gonna shoot that guy. You think whatever you want about me, but I love my child. That guy he shot was somebody's child. I'm gonna help you. You know why? Because you would never ever do it for me. And after this... You and I will both know who the better person is. - How's it coming? - It's coming just fine. It should be running pretty soon now. Pretty soon now? You were supposed to have her repaired over an hour ago. I guess that's the problem when you use cheap labour. Don't you talk that to me! Remember who's your boss here. - Of course. Denver's right? - How dare you! Come with me. It's the last time I'm gonna warn you. I thought we had understanding. I thought we had an agreement. I thought it's gonna be something... I thought this was gonna be mutually beneficial. You will learn to obey. We're gonna learn you respect me. And you're gonna learn to like it. Do you understand where I'm coming from? Elsa Thorne please report to warden's office immediately. - Elsa Thorne. - Shit! Elsa Thorne please report to warden's office immediately. Stay here. Don't dare to leave. I'll be right back. What's up doc? Not much. Hey, where did you come from? Where've you been? In a bit of rush today. Yeah, it's been kind of stressful day and I just need something to relax me. - Oh, some thing huh? - Come on, you know what I mean. And you know what I mean. Come on. - Wait. - What? - What about the baby? - He's asleep. - We can be quiet. - You will be. I'll be nice and quiet too. Baby, we'll get you too in a minute. We can talk about that later. You called. We're moving Solitaire out first thing tomorrow. She's being transferred. So we're folding, just like that. She's a wild card. There's no way of knowing what she'll do next. You know what, it's your program. By the way. Why is your hair wet? You gotta let me outta here! Danvers! Get Danvers! Let me outta here goddamn it! This had better be good. Solitaire, I am warning you! You better stop this right now! You're only making this worse for yourself. I thought you and I had an understanding! What's happening, what's wrong with her? I don't know. Well don't you think you should find out? And you call yourself security. - We gotta get out of here right now! - Calm down, Solitaire! - It's too late, we gotta go! - No one is going anywhere. - Do not make me use the teaser again. - You'll need a lot more than that. - Something's coming! - What's coming? Something evil! Solitaire, stop it! Stop it! You should listen to the warden, calm down. - What are you doing to me Swann? - I am making you stronger, Solitaire! I'll show you how strong I am! What is that stuff Swann? What have you been injecting me with? It's blood that can prolong your life. Strong enough to withstand aging, to stay off the disease! What are you talking about? Who's blood? You've seen him. You've had visions, you told Danvers. A man who died here twenty years ago, but who's blood lives on. What do you know about him? Because I saw him too. I was there. That night I collected Shadow's blood. And since that time I have dedicated my life to understanding and harnessing its true power! His blood is the life! And you've been keeping it all this time. For years it was nothing. All scientific analysis yielded nothing. But when they opened this place after 20 years I seized the opportunity to come back to the site where it all happened! And only then did his blood reveal its true power to me. But it doesn't look like you've benefit it. I would never dare to test this on myself until I found someone I thought was strong enough to survive it. That's what happened to Mondo. She didn't go crazy, you dosed her with his blood! I thought she would have the strength. It's a shame she didn't. But you do. Don't you notice how much more powerful you've become? Yeah. And I thought it was Danvers diet plan. Solitaire please, think of the possibilities! You and I are among the chosen few to attain immortality! No Solitaire! Think about this. This is the greatest chance of our lives. Emily! Emily! We gotta go now. We gotta go. Where's my baby? We need to get him! Somebody, guard, monitor room, somebody answer! - What a hell is going on here? - Just hang on the silence. Where have you been? I just found Hotrot dead in the shower room. Somebody ripped out her goddamn heart. Rise! Rise! Stop! I'll shoot! This is Rollins, they got it to block four. Fire. Shit! What the fuck! Where did you go? To hell and back. How do we stop those things? - A bullet in the head. - Or take them apart. They had no choice but to stay down. Look, we gotta get everyone out of here right now! They already have this place surrounded. You should know that for yourself. - We'll be safer if we just stay in here. - Yeah, for how long? They're not gonna wait for us to come outside! What are you saying? They're hungry, they're pissed off and they've got help. What do you mean help? We haven't seen the worst yet. You... You are back. - Do I know you? - Yes, that night I was there. I saw your true power with my own eyes. You were my executioner. Thank you. Your hands were the instruments of my destruction. Now it's your turn. I beg you, please forgive me. Enlighten me. I give my blood to those whom I choose. To those who choose to stay with me. I choose to serve you. I've kept your blood. It can restore you to your full power. Mother's blood can restore my full power! But I can help you. There's someone here who is as strong as you are. The girl. - How did you know? - I sensed her presence. Man's blood is weak! And coward's blood is weaker still. - Did you call for help? - The phones are dead. What's your plan now? I am not putting anyone else at unnecessary risk. We need to wait out the night... And then what? They'll all be gone by morning? Look Danvers, I'll lead the charge, we all gotta get out of here right now! I'm not leaving them trapped in there. You gotta go. Go! - Come on girls, come. - Hurry up. What a fuck are those things and where they come from? Get a grip I have no idea but we have got to stick together. Stick together? Seems like it's every woman for herself. Come on, get out of here! Solitaire! I'm stuck! Can't open the door! Help! - Fuck you! - Rage, come back! Hey, it's gotta be here! Get me out of here! Rage! Rage! No! Rage! Don't be foolish! - Hurry up! - Come on, girls! I tried to fight them. They're too many. It's okay. You fought them real good. All right, everyone up on the clow block. Look! We have got to stick together if we're gonna get through this. Now we'll be safe upon the clow block. - There's no way safe here. - Then what do you suggest? We don't wait for them to come to us. We break through one of the empty cell locks. - Then we have to fight them in the yard. - We have to fight them one way or another. I'm with her. - This isn't your decision to make. - News flash bitch. You don't run things around here anymore. Just a minute. There may be another way out of here. Down to the basement. - Okay, next idea. - I mean it! A passage way for stuf in case riots. It may still be open. I'm not risking everyone's life on an escape that may or may not be there. Then we'll check it out first. If it's open, we put everybody down. - And if not? - Then we're still trapped, aren't we? Wait, let me go with you. I have to find my baby. Emily, stay with Danvers. So who's this man you've been talking about? The monster who raped and murdered my mother. - I thought you killed him. - I thought so too. It's not very heroic. Killing the wrong man. I thought there was evidence. Where's this passage way you were talking about? Crystal? Is that you? Where've you been? Fuck this. Either they're dead or they got out. Neither way they are coming back for our sorry asses. No, Solitaire would never leave us behind. You know what, you can sit here and you go wait for her all night. I'm outta here. Who's with me? You want a rematch? Ah, shit! Get the fuck! Slow down. You don't get to tell me what to do. - Tough girl. - That's right. Delicious. Where is she? - Who? - The girl. The one with the power. - Fuck you! - Fuck me? I hear you. Where are you? - I'm coming! - Emily, no! No wait, it's not safe! I hear you. I'm coming! Wait, I hear you. I'm coming! Welcome. - Come on in. - Shut up. I've been waiting for you. You did feel my heartbeat. Your blood is... strong just like your mama's. I'm sorry. We haven't met. But we've been acquainted all our lives. I know you too well. Ever since I stepped foot in this place. And I know what you did to her! Really? Luisa was so clever. Mother's blood. So strong. I tried to preserve it but she escaped me before you were born. But now fate has delivered you to me. No. It's delivered you to me! Wonderful! You are strong! She would have been proud. And you're just as beautiful. Behind this beauty lies your destruction! That's what your mother told me just before she died. So I have left of her. Her blood lies in you. You want blood? Oh, who left you here? Mommy's got you. What is that? Why, you're hungry, is that it? Here. Behind this beauty lies your destruction. You're stronger than I anticipated. So it began with your mother and me. Now it's just us. Now you can doubt your strength, Cassandra. How do you know that? How do you know my name? I know more about you than you could possibly conceive. I barely knew your mother at all. She was just an appetizer. She would have never had you. She was my mother and you raped and murdered her! No you're wrong, Cassandra. I touched her. Then she became your mother. And then I murdered her. She was just a sacrifice for my immortality. But she tried to rob me of that when you were born. Can't you feel my blood boiling in your veins? You have no idea. Fate has brought us together so I can snatch it back! No. It's brought us together so I can avenge her! You talk about your mother's life. Yet you disavow the name she gave you. You call yourself Solitaire. - You wanna know why? - Yes. Because I love the sight of red on black.\n"

      "There. See that? We didn't see nothing, stranger. I see'd you sewing, though. First time I ever see a man sew like that. I done tailoring. How much you want to sew the seat in a pair of britches? I don't want work here. I'm going west. I don't, uh, aim to take something for nothing. I'll... I'll patch them britches. Pretty square tailor, ain't ya? Sit down till I get my garment. Where you coming from, stranger? East. Where you heading? West. What do you want out there? Land. Don't talk much, do you? Not unless I get something to say. - Here she is. - Uh... It might take a week of filing. I-if you get your nippers, you could... You're a fugitive. - I'd be aiding. - You, uh... I-- I was, uh, I was bound to a tailor back in Carolina. Runaway apprentice? You don't look young enough for that. You think I'm lying. Well, here. Read this. When an apprentice lights out and gets caught again he's got to serve out his time, don't he? - Miss Eliza! Miss Eliza! - Look! Well, where'd you get that? Howdy, Miss McCardle. Oh, good day, Blackstone. - Hello, Sam, Mordecai. - Howdy, Miss McCardle. - McCardle. - Hello, Mrs. Fisher. Good afternoon. You know those new boxes of books that came? I figured out how much shelf space is wanted, see? If you could bring some boards and a hammer and some nails-- I'll be right up to the library, Miss McCardle, as soon as I get Mrs. Fisher's mule shoed up. - Hello, Sheriff. - Good afternoon, McDaniel. Mordecai, who is he? Says he's apprentice what lit out. That what it says there? Yes, but they can't touch a runaway apprentice here in Tennessee, across the state line. Forget what I asked you, I'll patch your britches, as pay for this file here and be getting down the road. Never mind the britches now. Come here. Put your foot up here. This might hurt some, tailor. Huh, hurts worse where it is. What the Sam Hill? Well, that's like spring steel. Yeah. Get--get your hammer and chisel. But it'll half-kill you. It's been too long I got this thing on. I'm warning you, you might lose your ankle. Will you get your chisel? Go on, get it! He wants to be mule-headed... Speaking of mule.. Gram of White Mule might help some. I.--I can't touch that stuff. It makes me sicker than a hound dog. You know, this town could maybe use a man like you. Don't talk much, don't drink, lots of spunk. Ain't been a tailor hereabouts since ol' Finney got drunk and sewed his finger to a leg of the parson's pants. I ain't looking to do tailoring, ma'am. Man what can get to own land don't get chained up. Man who can sew like you could soon buy an acre here. Lots of folks here ain't got no basement nor britches. Brace his foot. Good morning! - Morning, Miss McCardle. - Morning, Miss Eliza. Oh, that's a fine job, Mordecai. I'm getting a pair of brand-new britches for doing this. Well, I thought those old ones of yours would be too much for any tailor. Well, Mrs. Fisher! Them cobwebs ain't been swept out since the Grangers lit out west, Miss McCardle. And I'll be choking and spitting for weeks to get the dust out of my lungs. Well, aren't you a good neighbor? I ain't been messing about in there to help that mule head. I'm a-gettin' paid. I'm gonna have the first new dress since the one I wore the day the parson tied me up. Good morning, Mr. Johnson. Morning. We haven't exactly met before. I'm Eliza McCardle from the library across the street. Yes, miss. Everyone's so pleased to have a tailor here again in Greeneville. Thank you, miss. I-it saves so much trouble not having to take my cloak and dress down to Nashville. Am I your first customer? Oh. It was you left that? I guess you are, then, miss. Is my work ready? Oh, you shouldn't be about on that foot. It does a man's foot good getting a shackle knocked off it. Yes, of course. Everyone's talking about what happened at the blacksmith's shop. What happened at the blacksmith's ain't nobody's business! Mr. Johnson. Forgot myself, miss, don't... don't pay no mind. I'll take my clothes now, if you please. There ain't nothing been done to them clothes, miss. Those clothes. But the instructions are plainly written. I know, miss, but... I can't read. \"Will you please lengthen the dress two inches at the hem and mend tear in cloak.\" I'll have it fixed tomorrow. Oh. How much will it cost? I ain't asking no favors from anybody, but... a fair bargain's a fair bargain. I don't understand. You... you know about books? A little, yes, but... I asked you how much my work would cost. And you--you speak nice. \"Them clothes,\" I said. Oh, I corrected you. It--it just slipped out. It was forward of me, I'm afraid. No, miss. I-I got to learn to speak right. You speak about the nicest I know of. Miss McCardle, I'll sew you all the clothes you can bring me, homespun, if you'll learn me to read and write. Your proposal, Mr. Johnson, seems rather unusual. Miss McCardle. I'll think it over. I-- I'm making you a fair offer. I-I never had no chance to learn. Will you learn me? I have never had a chance to learn. Will you teach me. Will you teach me? \"There is a lady sweet and kind, was never face so pleased my mind, I did but see her passing by and yet I love her till I die.\" Please go on. It's past time to close the library. Got to get home and read something besides poetry. Andrew. You've learned to read almost as well as I. You've made so many new clothes for me, it's almost sinful. Why do you want to go on with the lessons? Is this the... Words, I read somewhere, are verses the heart sets to music. Eliza, there's... music inside me that almost drowns out my thinking. But I'm a poor man and the law says a white man without property is nothing but a mudsill for other men to wipe their boots on. Why, no law says that. It don't have to say it, it's true, ain't it? Your people owned a house and land. How did my father get a house and land? By cobbling shoes for 20 years. My father was nothing but a mudsill, and he died one. Poor white trash, that was him, and that's me. I'll be going now. Andrew. Don't you know we were all mudsills once? Forget the history of England for tonight. Read your own history. Here. The Declaration of Independence. I've heard that spouted by stump speakers every Fourth of July since I can remember. Well, maybe you didn't understand it. Read this part here. \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.\" Uh, they're fine words, but they ain't true. Ain't no equality for mudsills. Go on. \"That they are... endowed by their Creator with certain... unalin--una--\" \"Unalienable rights.\" Rights no man can take away. Well, they have taken them away. What are you making me read this for, anyway? Go on. \"That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Why, a man ain't even got a right to vote without he owns property. Then why don't you make it your business to see that men without property are given the right to vote? - My business? - Certainly. You've got a temper, Andrew, but people like you. Go out and talk to them. Make speeches. Stand up for your rights and theirs, too. People wouldn't listen to me. I think they would. Anyway, the Constitution says you can try to make them listen. I s-suppose you'll be making me read the Constitution out loud to you. I will, if it will help you to understand it and realize that everything in the Bill of Rights and the Declaration, too, means you, personally. You, Andrew Johnson. It seems as--as if... Maybe I never really understood this before. The Constitution, neither. I suppose plain people can't agitate the way you want me to in them foreign countries. - Those foreign countries. - Those. No, of course they can't. The reason this is a free country is because here, what's wrong can be set right. Whatever is wrong has got to be set right by the people. You're the people. This is your country as much as theirs. It's my--my fish in the stream. Your flag on the fort. \"It's life, liberty...\" Finish the sentence, Andrew. \"The pursuit of happiness.\" They're all yours. The pursuit of happiness, too. The pursuit of happiness. And it says we were created... Go on. Equal. What it says must be right, Andrew. Created equal, you and me. Yes, Andrew. \"Votes for all free men.\" More than a year now, he's been putting leveling ideas like that into common folks' heads, Sheriff. Mm-hmm. White trash got enough to do hustling to make a living. And not sticking their snouts into what don't rightly concern them. Goes on like this, he'll rouse up the whole county. Too many property interests involved, Sheriff Cass. You see, Mrs. Johnson, them that own the country should run it. A man with land pays taxes, don't he? So ain't it right that he should have a say how the money is spent? Now you tell your husband to leave voting to the men of property. They'll look after the interests of folks like you. Well, surely, that's a matter of opinion, Sheriff. You have no right to keep him from speaking. Bill of Rights says there should be no law made to abridge freedom of speech. We're living in Tennessee. Well, we ain't abiding by no federal laws, less'n they suit us. Well, nothing's legal in this town if the Aldermen don't like it. Now, they don't like tailors rousing up the white trash and making leveling speeches. Goodnight. Uh, now don't forget, you tell Andy he ain't gonna hold no more meetings. Now, he's got a temper. Better make him see reason, else'n he might get hurt. - Evening, Eliza. - Evening. You're late for supper, dear. I had to go over and fit Mr. Bronson's coat. What was that hard-shelled, rum-dipped sheriff doing here? What's the matter, Martha? Hey, she ain't sick, is she? No, no, it's just her teeth bothering her. She used to sleep all the time. Now take your coats right off. Andrew, I kept a nice bit of salt pork warm and those baby cabbages you like so much. There's plenty for Mordecai, too. Uh, that's mighty fine of you, but it'll taste just as good cold. It's time to get my notes and go to the meeting. You'd better mind little Martha. I'd make a lot better speech with you there listening. Why, Eliza, you're all tensed up. Andrew, that meeting last week, there was some trouble, wasn't there? It didn't come to anything. Yes, but if one night it did, if someone got hurt... Eliza, what... what was Cass doing here? Ain't exactly like the sheriff to come social visiting. Eliza? Well, he came to say that the Aldermen won't allow the meeting tonight. Won't allow it? Well, I've got a piece to speak. That's what free speech is in the Constitution for, so as I can speak it. - Come on, Milligan. - We'll get our friends. What he really came to say was you can't hold meetings at all anymore or you might get hurt. Andrew, put away that gun. Please. - Stay home. - No, Eliza. Andrew, you shan't do this. You shan't! Nothing can keep me from going. Andrew! Mordecai! Don't worry none, Eliza. I promise, nothing will happen to Andrew. Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! There's been a bad ruckus at the town hall! No. No, you mind the baby. My husband. What happened? Where are they? Them that got hurt was carried over to the blacksmith's shop. Water! Get some water! Wh-where is... Where is... Anybody want to buy a first-rate blacksmith's shop? Mordecai Milligan's dead. - Where are you going? - To get Sheriff Cass. That ain't no private affair of yourn. How many men can we get together? I got close to 20 cousins in the county ain't standing by and see me get no hammering. And how about Milligan's kin? They ain't gonna put up with his killing. We can raise a 100 men by midnight. Them with no guns have scythes and axes. Round 'em up! Let's get started! If it's killing they want, let's give it to 'em! If I hadn't toted that gun, Milligan would be asleep in his bed in there. Not dead in it. That's right! And we're gonna make 'em pay for it! Put down those weapons! You're quitting on us, tailor? I ain't never quitting. From now on, never. Then come along! Join the party! You begun this, Andy, with your meetings and your telling us to stick up for our rights. You led the scrimmage when the sheriff's bullies started throwing us out the hall. You done more than your share of fighting your own self. And who pulled the gun first? It'll take me more than all my life... to pay for that. He's quitting on us. - Come on! - No! Mob fighting, shooting, and hanging and burning, that ain't the way! Eye for eye, tooth for tooth! That's Bible! So you want to start killing. First you kill, the militia comes from Nashville, then they start killing. And the dead they leave are you, Maude Fisher. And, Dick, you. And, Ebenezer, you. And, Ethan, you. And you. And you, McDaniel. Yes, I--I tell you to fight for your rights. But the Constitution ain't for the dead, it's to protect the living! Ain't nothing in it I know of says not to hang a murdering sheriff! It--it says the law hangs murderers! It--it says the people got the right to make the laws! That's--that's us! And that's how we're gonna win our fight election day! And when we win it, we'll--we'll get Cass indicted! How? Lots of us ain't even got a vote. You ain't got no vote, Andy. Well, a--a lot of us have. Come November, I'm gonna have my acre paid for and a vote. Then we can elect one of our own sheriff, a common man, one of us. - Now you're talking crazy. - Who'll we get? None of us is fitting. Most of us can't hardly read. We ain't good enough. We ain't got no rights! Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Those are our rights, as well as theirs. It's o-our fish in the stream our... our flag on the fort. Hey! What about the tailor? - He's fitting! - Yes! - That's right. - Andy would be good. Me? Wh... No. No, I-I... I ain't fit enough. You can read and write and figure! - And you can speak. - And you can fight. How about it, Andy? You're good enough. And fit enough. - Eliza's right! - Andy for sheriff! - We can put you in! - Andy the man. We'll beat their pants off and let you sew 'em up! - Andy for sheriff! - We want him! We want Andy! He'll be the sheriff! They put me up to do the introducing, here in Greeneville, of some old friends that don't need no introducing. Now most of you younger folks didn't know this lady here when she was Miss McCardle, a-passing out books at the library. And there's her daughter, Martha. You remember her. Many of you played in the streets with her. And now she's grown-up, too, married, and has a little boy of her own. And I almost forgot. There's a man here, too. A man that got his start in politics when a bunch of us made him run for sheriff. He said he wasn't fit enough. Well, he's been fit enough to be made sheriff, assemblyman, congressman, governor, and now he comes back to his home folks in his own town as senator of the United States. No, I ain't gonna introduce him, not in Greeneville. Welcome home, Andy! Welcome home! I guess Blackstone McDaniel is right. I don't need any introducing to you. I've patched the britches of a lot of you. And your fathers' britches before you. I'm still wearing that first little dress Andy made me. Well, it's mighty fine to be home again. My friends... I have been a Jacksonian democrat all my political life. I hope we will lick the Republicans this fall and send Abe Lincoln back to splitting rails in Illinois! But people here in the South who threaten to break up this country if Lincoln is chosen president, forget that in our America, the verdict of the majority must be accepted. That is what I will say in the Senate in Washington even if Lincoln is chosen president. I repeat, that is what I will say in the Senate whether you back me up at home here in Tennessee or whether you don't! We of the South have lost the election! Very well! Mr. Lincoln will be inaugurated president in six weeks! The people have spoken! Let the will of the people be done! We can vote Mr. Lincoln out of office in four years and I hope and believe we shall do so! Meanwhile, we southerners should remain here and prevent him from carrying out policies that will ruin this country, our one country! Enough of this Yankee cackle, you renegade to the South! I repeat, our one country! Does any senator dare to challenge that? Let us keep in our hearts the immortal toast of that great democrat, Andrew Jackson. \"Our federal union, it must be preserved.\" In the noble words of Daniel Webster, \"Liberty and union, now and forever, one and inseparable.\" The senator has been making that same speech here day after day for the past two months. Like a parrot. What can you expect from a mudsill tailor elected by the rabble of the city among the gentlemen of the South? I'm proud of having been a tailor and I'd rather sit among the rabble than some of you self-appointed gentlemen of the South. - I demand an apology! - An apology for what? Mr. President! While the Southern senators make this place a beer garden business north and south is at a standstill! And who is to blame? Yes, who is to blame? You are! You are! Men of the North, if you force us to fight for our liberties, then we'll fight you! Don't you shake your fist at us! We're not your slaves! - Don't you yell at us! - Well, you started it! Gentlemen, this is the Senate of the United States, not a pot house! Order in the galleries! Order on the floor! Jefferson Davis. He's finally got here. It's about time. Now he can speak for all of us. For the whole South. The chair recognizes the senator from Mississippi. Mr. President of the Senate. Senators. I appear here... to announce to the Senate that Mississippi, by solemn ordinance... and in convention assembled... has declared her separation from the United States. In so doing, she has followed others of her sister states on whose behalf, as well as my own... I must pronounce our solemn farewell. Under these circumstances, of course, my functions and those of my colleagues terminate here. We but tread in the path of our fathers when we proclaim our independence and take the hazard putting our trust in God... and in our own firm hearts... and strong arms... we will vindicate the right as best we may. I see now around me some with whom I have served long. There have been points of collision. For whatever offense I have given, I ask forgiveness. Or whatever of offense that has been to me, I leave here. I carry with me no hostile remembrance. I go hence unencumbered of the remembrance of injury received... and having discharged the duty of making the only reparation in my power... for any injury offered. Mr. President, senators, having made the announcement which the occasion seemed to me to require, it remains only for my colleagues and myself... to bid you a final... adieu. Now that Tennessee has left the Union and joined the Confederacy, I denounce Andrew Johnson as a traitor to the sovereign state of Tennessee! May your black tongue rot in your throat, you liar! No man can call me a traitor! Andrew. Oh, thank you, Andrew. I was so afraid there'd be violence. From now on, there will be nothing but violence, Eliza. Nationwide violence. No, it mustn't come to that. Isn't there some peaceful way of settling it? The Southern senators walked out. They declared war. I'm going to Lincoln now and offer my services to raise troops in Tennessee and fight for the Union. - Where's the general, sir? - At his gun. Captain Brenner! - Message from General Williams? - Only verbal, sir. General Williams was in action, trying to rally the Zouaves. Trying to rally them? What's happened? Our center is broken! General Williams asks that all available reserves be sent to him immediately! There are no reserves! The rebels just sent over another white flag with a demand to surrender Nashville! You order General Williams for me to shoot any man who talks of surrender! Yes, sir. Four more years! Four more years! Boys! Boys! Close the window! Come on. Let's get on with the business. Gentlemen, not that anyone cares, of course, but we have one more tiresome formality now that we've done our duty by old Abe-- Wasn't us delegates re-nominated Lincoln by acclamation. The country done that. Sir, I'm not accustomed to being interrupted. Thad Stevens. Most of us delegates ain't congressmen and you can't treat us like you do that tame cattle of yours down in Washington. Eh, my Pennsylvania delegation and some others that I have friends in will support anyone you men decide you want. Just agree on a name. Well, there'd be no trouble if Lincoln would let us know who he wants on the ticket with him. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Well, it looks as though the White House decided to tell us something. Ah, clear out of here, you men. How do you do? - Oh, so glad to see you. - Glad to see you. The president hopes you're better, Congressman Stevens. Thank you, thank you. Afternoon, Senator Waters. Afternoon, BP. White House, Senate, House of Representatives. What we three agree on ought to go down with this mob. The president is very grateful for the plank and the platform that favors full emancipation. Well, I wrote it myself. But he wasn't so happy about that other plank you forced in. Oh, that one demands that the rebels and traitors are punished after the war. What's wrong with that? Well, he feels that it's a blow to his policy of reconciliation. Well, that's just why it's there. Come on. Let's quit playing marbles. Lincoln sent you down here to see Jim and me. What for? To discuss the vice presidency. Yeah, he wants to shove Andy Johnson down our throats. The president feels that Johnson, a democrat, will be supported by the democrats who backed the war and so will help us win the election. He says to tell you that a vice president from a rebel state will strengthen the Union. That the American people can never repay their debt of gratitude to Andrew Johnson. Oh, Johnson's a loyal man, uh... But as a southerner, he'd be bound after the war to try and stop our vengeance on the South. Mr. Lincoln does not approve of vengeance on anyone. In the interest of unity, he's anxious for a unanimous nomination, no contest on the floor. You tell the president I'll support his wartime policy until the last rebel's dead or quits. He knows you will. The president regrets that you don't agree with him on reconstruction, but he knows that you stand with him on the two important issues, victory and freedom. I fought slavery all my political life. - What's that got to do with it? - Oh, a great deal. Why, Johnson stands with you and Lincoln there. He once said in a speech, \"I do not mourn over the dead body of slavery. I think we're freeing more whites than blacks in Tennessee.\" I wouldn't want to free a white man if he was a rebel. Well, I've said all the president asked me to say. What Lincoln wants will go down with the delegates, then. What the president wishes will go down because you and the other delegates know that the country is behind him. Good afternoon. Ah. Thad, you can't fight Lincoln on the floor here. If he wants Johnson, you better make it unanimous. That mudsill tailor. From the heart of the rebel land... next vice president of the United States. The oath of office will now be administered to the vice president-elect by the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Vice President-elect. Mr. Chief Justice. Raise your right hand, sir, and repeat after me. I do solemnly swear... I do solemnly swear... ...that I will faithfully execute the office of vice president of the United States... ...that I will faithfully execute the office of the vice president of the United States... ...and will, to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend... ...to the best of my ability, preserve... Protect, and defend... Protect, and defend... ...the Constitution of the United States, so help me God. ...the Constitution of the United States, so help me God. The President of the United States! Mr. President... senators... judges... people of the United States who are... are more-- I ask your indulgence. Drunk again. I ask your indulgence during my term of office. I, a plebeian, have studied only how best to advance the... interest of my state and country. I have... risen from the humblest walks of life to this--this... this proud position. \"...with malice toward none.\" This is the way he wound up, Eliza. I wish you'd got to town in time to hear him. I wouldn't have heard him. I'd have been right here, looking after you in bed, where you belong. They sent me this this morning. It's a photograph of the inaugural ceremony. See, there he is, reading his speech. The people will gaze on that picture for ages to come. Where are you, Andrew? There I am, my dear, in the custody of Hannibal Hamlin. The cool air out there cleared my head. You see, I'm holding my hat over my face. Perhaps you can guess why. Now, don't you want to hear what they have to say about your husband's speech? No, Andrew, please. \"After being sworn in, the new vice president indulged in an incoherent harangue, concerning which, the less said, the better, in view of the obvious condition of the man between whom and the presidency stands only one human life.\" Stop, Andrew. You were ill. I disgraced my president. I disgraced my country and our cause. Come in. From the White House, Mrs. Johnson. Flowers for you and a letter for Mr. Johnson. Thank you. Aren't they beautiful? I... I'm afraid to open this. Oh, you needn't be. Mr. Lincoln sees deep into all hearts and he knows yours, all wool and a yard wide. \"You ornery old galoot. If only you took a drink now and then, you'd know enough about liquor not to fire yourself up with brandy on an empty stomach when you're sick. I know you only went through the ceremony for me because I asked you to. Don't worry at what they say. In hitting at you, they're hitting at me and I don't mind. We've got Lee all but whipped. You were a good tailor, Andy. And you're going to help me now, you poor, loyal cuss, to patch up the torn garment of our Union. Gratefully yours, A. Lincoln.\" Didn't I tell you? Three cheers for Vice President! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Evening, Mr. Johnson. I'm afraid all this noise will be disturbing Mrs. Johnson. I'm awfully sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it. That's perfectly all right. She only wishes she could get out and join in the jollification herself. She'll be up tomorrow. Sleep well, Mr. Vice President. We'll all sleep well now, the first time in four years. Oh, just a moment, please, sir. I forgot something, if you please. This gentleman called while you were out. No, I don't know the name. Probably he's just some office-seeker. - Hello, hello, dear. - Hello. Well, you should see that city out there. Oh, I can feel it even lying here in bed. It's a new Washington since Lee surrendered. New country, same crowd, same bands all over the north. People don't seem ugly or vindictive now that we've won, do they? No, this is the start of a new era of good feeling in a United States really united and for the first time. And we both know whom the country has to thank. Yes, we all know, except that little knot of his enemies down on Capitol Hill. His enemies and yours. Mm-hmm. Just listen to that noise out there, will you? We want Andy! They're calling for you, Andrew. We want Andy! We want Andy! Stop the music! Stop it! Yeah! We want to hear Andy! My friends and fellow countrymen... Hang Jeff Davis to a sour apple tree! Hang Lee, too! My friends... Never mind me. You go around the corner and serenade the president, but don't grieve him with shouts about hanging our fellow countrymen. Come on down, Andy, and have a drink, you old toper! I repeat, you should be around at the White House. Not here. We just came from there, Andy. Ain't nobody home. Abe Lincoln's gone to Ford's Theater. Few words I shall say to you, and not my own. \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, let us bind up the nation's wounds.\" And General Grant, when he took Lee's army, there was no pride, no boasting. He just said, \"Let us have peace.\" Now, you trust and follow Mr. Lincoln to guide us under God for four years more! Oh, splendid, Andrew. You said just the right thing. Now, you try to get some sleep. Let's hope there will be no more bands to keep you awake tonight. I will. Here, what are you reading? Poetry. \"There is a lady, sweet and kind, it was never a face so pleased my mind.\" Oh, please don't close the doors and don't you sit up working half the night. I won't. Just a half-hour or so. Yes. Who is it? Mr. Johnson, the president's been shot. Don't go, sir. There's murder all through the city. Secretary Seward's just been stabbed at his house and we got here just in time to save you from an assassin outside your door. It's a general conspiracy. I'm going to the president. You must stay here, sir. I'm posting a guard outside. I must go, Eliza. Of course you must. Now he belongs to the ages. It is now my duty to ask when it will be convenient to administer the oath of office... Mr. President. All right, Major, take these away. And, uh... I want that report on the Freedmen's Bureau to work on tonight. Thank heavens there's nobody else waiting here to see me. Has this young lady an appointment, Major Crook? - She didn't ask for one, sir. - Mm-hmm. Here, here, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, Major, don't forget those two bills. We got to write a couple more veto messages after dinner. I must have seen 60 people in this room today and you're the first one didn't come in to ask me for something. Oh. Where did you get your flowers? I picked them on the lawn with Martha. She just had the children out there for a romp. How did they stand the trip from Nashville? They loved every minute of it. It'd be kind of homelike, Eliza, to have Martha and the kids living here. This place seems sort of lonesome. I don't know. Maybe it's just the job. Must be the lonesomest job in the world. Such a big place, isn't it? Glad I don't have to pay the taxes on it. And so full of ghosts. Ghosts that are hard to live up to. I bark out at people. He knew how to turn 'em down with just a funny story. The wonder of it... that you should work in his study... sit at his desk. The terror of it, to ask myself every day, every hour, \"What would he have done?\" And not to know. Eliza... I ain't fit. Andrew, it came to us at Milligan's forge that you were fit to be sheriff and you've grown a lot since then. You trying to tell me that I'm fit to follow him? You know better than that. To follow him who is whoever will be. The trouble with me, Eliza, I was never fit to lace up his boots, let alone stand in them. You were the man he chose, Andrew, to stand in his boots if anything should happen to him. Oh, let me. I told Martha she could bring the children in to say goodnight. Well, I must be the first president with grandchildren here. We'll let them come in every night. Grandpa, my doll! Isn't she beautiful? Oh, isn't she? Hey, Andy, Andy! Hey there, Andy! What-- Well, now, what have we got here? Major Crooks gave it to me. It's a gun to shoot bears. Well, now, we'll go out tomorrow morning right after breakfast and shoot us some bears. - Come on! Let's go now! - No! Tell me a bedtime story, Grandpa, like you always used to in Nashville when I was little. All right. Here... we go. Well, now. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess. Oh, look! There's a great bad bear! Oh, come in, gentlemen, come in. You know my wife, my daughter, Mrs. Paterson, the children. Congressman Stevens, Senator Waters, and Congressman Hargrave. Yes, it's quite a thing to have a typical American family in the White House again, Mrs. Johnson. It's a great pleasure to welcome you to Washington, ma'am. All Washington hopes, Mrs. Johnson, for a revival of the fine, old White House traditions of before the war. Well, then I'm afraid Washington will be disappointed. Oh, we're just plain people from the hills, that's all. A brief stay in high places can't be expected to change us very much. Martha. Now, children, it's your bedtime. Grandpa hasn't told me my story yet. Well, he'll come up and tell you one in bed. - Promise? - Yes, I promise. Now, you say goodnight to the gentlemen. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. May I have a kiss, little one? Yes, if you want one. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Do you want to have a kiss, too? I couldn't think of anything more delightful, but I'm not going to submit you to any such dubious pleasure. You killed the bear! I didn't mean to. Now, children, that's enough. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Well, we've had enough homespun humor in the White House. Let's quit being whimsical and run the country. Sit down, gentlemen. You know, I've often thought if I could speak with your culture and learning, with your eloquence, Mr. Hargrave, or the power and force that you blast your opponents with, Mr. Stevens, I'd probably make a much better president. Why, Mr. President, I've never found you lacking in eloquence, sir. But unfortunately, you are as stubborn as the orneriest mule in your own Tennessee. He just plants his feet wide apart like that and you couldn't budge him with a cannon. A mule, huh? Is that why you fellas in Congress lit a fire under me? You don't act like our fire done much more than keep your belly nice and warm. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the contraption you're hitched to is the United States of America. We've gotta keep it on the move. Stevens, if you'll just state your case and let me state mine, I think we'll see better where we stand. Very good, Mr. President. I propose that we treat the South as an outside conquered people, that we confiscate all estates worth 10,000 dollars and containing 200 acres. Then, sir, I would give every adult colored man forty acres of land. Sell the rest and pay for the war with it. No use vetoing that program, Johnson. We have the votes to override your vetoes. So it comes to this. You fought a war to preserve the Union. Having preserved it, now you deny that it exists. Gentlemen, my one aim is to carry out Lincoln's policies. Try and get into your head that Lincoln's reconstruction program died with him. Oh, shut up, Waters. Let the president state his own case. Lincoln always held that the Confederate states could not secede. That they were therefore never out of the Union. Now, they stopped fighting. They took the oath of allegiance to the United States. They ratified the amendment abolishing slavery that you yourself, Stevens, piloted through congress. Ah, yes, yes, yes. It follows from Lincoln's policy that they therefore were entitled to the same rights as the rest of us. Now, gentlemen, it's just as simple as that. Well, no use making him our offer now, Stevens, after what he just said. Offer? You have some compromise to suggest? I should think it would be rather difficult to compromise our points of view. I never compromise. I came here to make a deal. To secure your cooperation with us, Mr. President. For the next eight years. Oh, I see. That's, uh, an offer to buy me... with a second term. One practical man to another, yeah. What in tarnation is that thing? What you're trying to put on my leg again and I don't like being chained up. That's why I've kept this for nearly 40 years now, just to remind me what being chained up feels like. Well, gentlemen, there's a little girl waiting for me to tell her a bedtime story, so I guess that's all. Oh, no, no. That's not all, Mr. President. That's only half. Now, wait outside, will you? I want a word alone with the president. - Goodnight, Mr. President. - Goodnight, Mr. President. Goodnight, gentlemen. Goodnight. First, Lincoln tried to block me. Now it's you. Well, that's a poor substitute, but now me. Stevens, why did you want to see me alone? To tell you that since you've turned me down, I fear I'll have to turn you out. Impeachment? You know the House would prefer charges of high crimes and misdemeanors against you anytime I say. I hope that never happens. Unfortunately, it takes a two-thirds vote of the Senate to sustain a conviction. That's the Constitution. You're a great stickler for the Constitution, aren't you? Well, you might as well know, then, we can get you out by strictly Constitutional means. Why aren't you more reasonable? And when there's no vice president, the man who succeeds an impeached president is the acting presiding officer of the Senate. Right, right. Well, they'll never put me out to put Jim Waters in. Well, that is kind of funny, at that. The Senate would never have elected him to pound that gavel if they realized that it might make him president. I have infinite faith in the people. Oh, this country isn't ruled by a plebiscite. Congress would be against you and the money power and the press. Yes, every power would be against me except the common people that Abe Lincoln said the Lord must have loved because He made so many of them. Well, go ahead, then, take the stump. Swing around the circle. Make your speeches to the people. Only you get all het-up. You don't make very good speeches. Yes, and you'd rig the press and pack my meetings. Well, we're not likely to meet socially anymore so I have to tell you that nothing would make me do what I fear I have to do, no personal or party interests, just one thing. The safety of our country which your policies would destroy. You have the impudence to sit there and tell me you're doing this to save the country? Why, you hypocrite, if you weren't a cripple, I'd pick you up and throw you through that bay window right out on the White House lawn, wheelchair and all! You know, most people think that drink is your weakness on account of that thing that happened at the inauguration. But I know better. It's temper. I've got to see Mr. Stevens at once. You can't, sir. He's sick, Mr. Secretary. - The doctor just left-- - Now, don't argue with me. Thad, he's turned me out. The tailor turned me out. You've got to do something to help me. Now, sir, Mr. Stevens is a very sick man. You can't be bothering him. I won't let you. Mr. Stevens, you've got to rest. Oh, Addie, what do they care whether I live or die, as long as I hold a job? Now, please, sir, don't say nothing about dying. There it is, Thad. Read it. Run along, Addie. If'n you get the lung fever, don't blame me. I done told you, the doctor, he say you've got to get your rest. So the tailor threw you out, huh? And after all the trouble we took to have that bill passed that he couldn't fire any of Lincoln's cabinet without the express consent of the Senate. He's violated a law passed over his own veto. That's going to cost him the presidency. I've got him just where I want him. Now, you go back and stay in your office. But I've been dismissed. You don't think I'm going to let him do a thing like that to you? Now, you go and get some troops and a couple of cannon to protect the building. Troops? Cannon? Sure. And just stay in office. - You mean, never leave it? - Leave it? No, of course not! You just stay, stay, and stay. Well, you better get a bed and some canned food because in all probability, you'll be there for three or four months. But after Johnson's out and Jim Waters is president, well, then you can go home and get all cleaned up. I'll do exactly as you say. Ah, it's amazing what privations a politician will endure just to stay in office. Here's the last report on the cabinet meeting and that's the last bit of what you call spying I'll have to do for you. You never can tell. I might want you to spy on Jim Waters when he's president. Addie! Addie! - Yes, sir? - Come here! Yes, sir, Mr. Stevens! - Order my carriage. - Tonight, in this rain? No, sir! You'll get your death of-- Order my carriage! If'n you go out in this rain and get the lung fever-- Get me my crutches! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Who are you to tell me what I can do and what I can't do. Yes, sir. I'll do what I want. I'll die when I feel like it. The president will see you now. What's this about some amnesty idea of yours, Johnson? So your spy in my cabinet told you that, too. Well, after you broke up my meetings, I got to wondering whether I had any powers left at all, if I hadn't better resign and go back home. Oh, cut the cackle. And then I remembered a power vested in the president by the Constitution that even Congress can't touch, Stevens. Maybe you can guess what it is. A power Congress can't touch? Yes. Lincoln would've got around to that before now, but I had to wait till things settled down a bit. You wouldn't dare. That's right, you've guessed it, the pardoning power. I'm gonna sign something now and I'm glad you came over here to watch me do it. Here at this desk where Lincoln freed the slaves I now free their former masters. This proclamation pardons all and restores full citizenship to all who fought for the lost cause in the war between the states. All? Did you say all? All. - Not Jeff Davis? - Jeff Davis, too. Lee? Oh, yes, Lee, as well. Well, you're right, you have the power. Congress can't stop you. Now every rebel snake in the South will crawl out of its hidden den into the daylight. Johnson, what you've just done tonight... and what you plan to do means a new Civil War. You honestly believe that, don't you? You know I do. I haven't long to live. Just kept alive for the day of retribution and justice so I could die happy knowing I'd bequeathed the country peace. Peace? You call revenge, confiscation, and disfranchisement peace? Have you no pity for those four million injured, depressed, hopeless colored people under bondage for two centuries? I want the two races to live together peacefully, to respect one another. Your way of making slaves of the whites would put that off another century. Johnson, if you withdraw this thing... for the sake of peace, I'll quash the impeachment. So you'd drop the impeachment. Uh, yeah. Well, Stevens, I decline your offer. But I want to tell you one thing. I never really understood you until this minute. I always thought you wanted a puppet President you could boss. I called you a hypocrite. You're not. You're a very sincere man... and that's what makes you so dangerous. You have the sincerity and will and force. You have the drive of a great fanatic. You'll not rob me of all I've lived for. You'll not ruin the country with another war. I'll live long enough to stop that. My policies will go through with you out of the way. Even if I'm not here to see it. Stevens... what's the matter with you? You'd better let me get you some coffee. Huh? No. I'll crush you, Johnson. I'll save our country yet. Stevens. Stevens! Major Crooks! Mr. President. What happened? Get a doctor. Ah... Would you deny any other tailor his day in court if you were his lawyers? If I took refuge in your technicalities and cowered here in the White House while you fellows fought for me in the Senate, what could Stevens call me? Whatever he calls you, Mr. President, he mustn't spatter you with mud and filth while you sit there in person. Yes, like a man in the dock. President is more than a man. He's a symbol of the whole nation. And that's why, for the sake of the dignity of your office-- Look, you--you can't--you can't fool me! You're afraid if I went down there, Stevens and his gang would bait me in making a howling jackass of myself. That's your real reason for trying to keep me from going to my own trial. Well, I choose to face my enemies in person. I'm going to the capitol. Come along, gentlemen. - Andrew. - Wish me luck, Eliza. There's no hurry, Andrew. Why sit down there alone in the President's room fidgeting until they summon you? The President will drive to the Senate a little later. - Uh, will I have time? - Oh, yes, Mr. President. The preliminaries and the swearing-in will take another hour or so. You see? - Reserved seats. - Reserved seats. Huh. It's like walking into Ford's Theatre knowing what's going to happen. Yes, another assassination of the President. Any statement for the AP, Mr. Stevens? Well, don't quote me, but I think I got the tailor just where I want him. - But for quotation? - Quote. The days of the tyrant are numbered. Unquote. The country's greatly disturbed about your illness. Well, tell the country I'm all right. I just had a stroke, that's all. No further statement. - Thank you, Mr. Stevens. - Thank you. The honorable managers of the House of Representatives. Who's going to carry me about when you two boys are dead and gone? The President of the Senate pro tempore recognizes the spokesman for the House of Representatives. In the name of the House of Representatives and of all the people of the United States we do impeach Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors. We shall exhibit our articles of impeachment and make them good. In fulfillment of the mandate laid down in article one, section three of the Constitution, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall preside over the Senate when, as now, this body is called to sit as a high court of justice in judgment upon the President of the United States. The honorable Chief Justice! Your Honor. The chair recognizes Mr. Stevens. Mr. Chief Justice, before the 11 articles of impeachment are formally read let me state to the Senate and the country the essence of our indictment. We do not intend to cite the obvious fact that Andrew Johnson is unmindful of the dignity of his office, his disgraceful speeches of rage, if not intoxication. We will confine ourselves to the Constitution and the law. Now, in a public speech, the President of the United States suggested hanging certain elected representatives of the people, including myself. He has denied, also in a public speech, that this congress is a lawful body. He has termed us an \"illegal rump\" because we refuse to admit what he terms \"legally elected representatives of states in the American Union,\" meaning unreconstructed rebels. Now, our main case, however, is based on his violation of a law passed over his veto by Congress. The Tenure of Office Act. Now, everyone in the country knows that that forbids a President to dismiss from his cabinet any member who was belonged to the cabinet of a President who died in office. Now, in so doing, Andrew Johnson, who was sworn to maintain the Constitution, created the highest possible Constitutional crime. If this is condoned, Congress will be powerless. It will be ruled over by an irresponsible tyrant. So the House of Representatives, by solemn resolution, has instructed us, its managers, to demand that the Senate, as made mandatory by the Constitution, forthwith summon and do justice upon the accused, Andrew Johnson. Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to keep silent while the Senate of the United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of impeachment. Summon the accused. Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, appear and answer the articles of impeachment exhibited against you by the House of Representatives of the United States. Andrew Johnson. Andrew Johnson. Andrew Johnson! What's this mean, Thad? Ah, Johnson isn't coming. Mr. Chief Justice, the President desires to be represented throughout this trial solely by his counsel. Mr. Chief Justice, the President has been summoned and refused to appear. This action defies the Senate, Congress, and the whole American people. We demand that he be brought before this tribunal and stand his trial like any other man accused of crime. The Constitution does not require the presence of the respondent. The chair rules that he may, at his wish, be represented by counsel. The clerk will now read the articles of impeachment exhibited against Andrew Johnson by the House of Representatives. \"Article One, whereas Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, has been accused of conduct...\" Well, Blackstone, it's good to see you. Andy. Come on in here now and sit down. Oh, I, uh... I wanted to, uh, wanted to thank you for calming down the folks back home. Just sit down, sit down. Well, what's on your mind, now? Things ain't so good down there, Andy. What, in Greeneville? The Senate. Ah, sitting there at my trial every day, listening to the way they kick me around kind of makes you sore, huh? It sure does, Andy. Now, Blackstone, here's the way I figure. Out of 54 votes, they need 36 to get the two-thirds for conviction. Now we only need 19 for acquittal and we know we got 16 to start with. Wish I knew where those other three were coming from. Why, from honest senators who really believe that I violated the Constitution when I got rid of that spy in my cabinet. But they'll switch when they hear the truth from the other cabinet members. You go on back there now and listen to our side. Andy... what I come up here for to tell you before anybody else did was, uh... they ain't gonna let your witnesses testify. Who won't? The Chief Justice? That's--that's not possible. He's an honest man. Oh, he ruled for you, all right, but the Senate overruled him on every point. Now, now, Andy, don't fly off the handle. Well, I expected everything but this. Accusations of drunkenness! Galleries packed with my enemies howling and yelling against me! Even that old charge in Congress that I conspired to murder Lincoln! But I never expected this! Well, I'll--I'll issue a statement to the country right now. It's too late, Andy. They're gonna start voting right soon. I should have gone down there and stood up to them in the beginning. This is no state trial. It's a criminal conspiracy! They're... they're doing this to me because I'm trying to carry out his policies. They'd be doing it to him, too, if he were alive and in my shoes! They'd be trying to destroy the-- Andrew. We could hear you shouting all over this end of the White House. People all over Washington are gonna hear me shouting! People all over this country are gonna hear me shouting! Those senators up on that hill are gonna hear me shouting! Once more I must caution the galleries to keep quiet. Mr. Chief Justice, the case for the House of Representatives and the people of the United States is concluded. After the closing speech for the defense has been made, vote will be taken upon the guilt or innocence of the President of the United States. - Mr. Chief Justice-- - The President! - The President? - The President? Mr. President, this is highly inadvisable. You should have notified us. I've been waiting a long time for this. Mr. Chief Justice, the closing speech for the defense will be made, at his own desire, by the respondent. That will be in order. He'll blow up higher than a kite and cook his own goose. Mr. Chief Justice... One of the first rules of... When the people of U-- Will the President please be seated? After repeated warnings, the chair now orders the attendants to clear the galleries. Clear the galleries! Mr. Chief Justice, I protest against your order to exclude the people from this chamber where their fate is about to be decided. Yes, there's an organized focus of disorder. The ruling of the chair must stand. I move the galleries be not cleared! I second the motion! Those in favor of overruling the chair respond by saying \"Aye.\" - Aye! - Aye! - Aye! - Aye! - Contrary, no. - No. - No. - No. The ayes have it. The galleries will not be cleared. The Chief Justice of the United States must now decline to preside over this body while an organized clack denies respectful hearing to the President of the United States. Article one, section three of the Constitution says the Chief Justice must preside when the President is impeached. True, but I must decline to continue to do so on the grounds that it was obviously the intent of the Constitution to place the Chief Justice in the chair in order to insure a fair trial. Under the Constitution, this trial cannot proceed without the Chief Justice in the chair. Of course, a way out of the difficulty might be found if the galleries would cease these interruptions. Now that order has been restored, the President will proceed. Mr. Chief Justice. If, as has been charged, I have sometimes not been mindful enough of the dignity of my office, I am certainly mindful of it now. I kept away from my own trial... following the best advice I know of... to avoid the sort of rough-and-tumble that would heat up not only this body but the whole country to a fever point where riot and bloodshed might have swept our people. I am charged with the high crime or is it a misdemeanor? Of making speeches in a state of mingled intoxication and rage. You were drunk inauguration day! You know you were! The attendants will remove the interrupter! Please, Mr. Chief Justice, I... I want that man to hear my answer. Very well. I have a letter in my pocket. I didn't bring it down here to read to the Senate. I have it with me because I always carry it. It's my most precious possession. I shall now read a few lines from this letter as my only reference now or ever to what my... my friend in the gallery has touched upon. \"You ornery old galoot, if only you took a drink now and then, you would know enough about liquor not to fire yourself up with brandy on an empty stomach when you're sick. I know you only went through the ceremony for me because I asked you to. Don't worry at what they say. In hitting at you they are hitting at me and I don't mind.\" This letter is dated from the White House March the fifth, 1865. I just heard that the Senate had refused to hear the evidence of my cabinet. Gentlemen, prepare to prove that my removal of a cabinet member was solely intended to test the Constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act before the Supreme Court. So... I won't deny that I was a little hot under the collar when I left the White House. But the ride down Pennsylvania Avenue cooled me off. And I came to realize that the crime for which I am being tried here is not contained in the flimsy charges trumped up in the articles of impeachment. It appears to have been one of misunderstanding. I thought the war had ended. It seemed so, no enemy confronted us on any field. The hand of friendship was stretched out, and I clasped it. Is forgiveness a crime? My enemies think so. They're not willing to forgive. For, senators, in this crowded chamber there still stand 20 empty desks. Why are those desks empty? Where are the senators who should be sitting at them? They have been lawfully elected, but they're not here. Why? The man most responsible for the fact that we are still at war although the guns are silent... sits there at that table. I wish to say that he is a sincere man. It is his honest belief that by pardoning the Confederate leaders, I made inevitable another Civil War. He hates the South with such consuming passion that he thinks, as he has said, that it must be kept in subjugation and slavery for the next 100 years. If I am removed from office, the new President, who shares the sentiments of Mr. Stevens, will set up a junta that will be no government of United States, but a self-perpetuating, corrupt tyranny based upon bayonets, confiscation, and disfranchisement. Abraham Lincoln fought this war to restore the Union. Long ago, the fighting stopped. But while those desks remain empty, there is no Union. Senators, while we were fighting one another, a European tyrant, master of the strongest army in the world, seized our sister Republic of Mexico. If we continue a divided nation, the day will come when still stronger armies and fleets from overseas will conquer and enslave not only our central and south American brethren, but ourselves as well. As our forefathers knew, united we stand, divided we fall. Senators, the issue before you and before the whole country is not my fate as an individual. It is the issue of union or disunion and upon its solution depends, for our descendants if not ourselves, this nation's survival or its destruction. The event is in the hands of God. Order must be maintained in the galleries. The clerk will now call the roll. Mr. Albert. Mr. Senator Albert, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. - What goes on? - It's Huyler. He's fainted. Go get a doctor! We can't do without him! Mr. Arnold. Mr. Senator Arnold, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. Mr. President. Andrew, Andrew. Oh, Andrew. As my husband, you've always held my love and respect, but today you really stand forth for me, the President of the United States. Well, Eliza, I'm--I'm glad to hear you say that since I'm not likely to hold this job for more than a couple of minutes longer. Well, if that should be true, nothing... nothing in your presidency has become you so much as... as your leaving it. Then this means, if you can vote Huyler-- We'll vote him. We're gonna carry him in, drag him in. - The voting's nearly over. - Come on. Man, even with Huyler, the whole thing turns on me. Just think what it means, asking me to make myself President with my own single vote, judge in my own cause. Stevens isn't asking you. He's telling you. But he agreed the dignified thing was for me to sit there and just answer \"present\" when they called my name. He told you that when he thought we could win without you. What will the country say if the case turns on my vote? What will history say? Mr. Senator Vincent, how say you? Is the r-- - Guilty. - Senator Vincent, is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Mr. Waters. Mr. Senator Waters, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Good old Jim. We're still one short. Well, Huyler can still vote if he gets here before the acquittal's announced. - He's unconscious. - Well, bring him to. - I can't-- - We mustn't lose the country by one vote. I think we're safe. - I must go and tell him. - Not so fast. The formalities will take another minute. We might still lose if they get Huyler in here to vote. Upon the roll call, 53 votes were cast and one senator did not answer to his name. Under the Constitution, the vote... Huyler just came to. They're dragging him in here. Well, hurry up, I'll keep the Chief Justice from finishing the announcement. ...necessary for conviction. Mr. Chief Justice, in the name of the House of Representatives and of the people of the United States, I protest! Senator Huyler has publicly announced he was going to vote guilty! The manager is out of order. Senator Huyler must vote. His vote is necessary to save the country. Would you throw the nation into chaos and start a new Civil War on a point of order? Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, has been adjudged guilty by 35 senators. If this outrage is consummated on this floor, guns and knives will be brought into play within the hour... on every street corner, in every city, town, and hamlet in the United States! You stand in most gross contempt, sir! Remove Mr. Stevens from the floor. Why, Senator Huyler's vote should be counted, anyhow. Everyone knows it was pledged against Johnson. A new Civil War, that's what you're starting, a new Civil War. This is the most gross miscarriage of justice in human history. If the Chief Justice pronounces those words that are even now trembling on his tongue, the only hope for the salvation of this-- Here's Huyler! - There you are, Huyler. - Good old boy. I knew we could count on you. Mr. Chief Justice, the roll call was completed. The President stands acquitted by one vote. Mr. Chief Justice, under the rules, any senator who appears on the floor before the result has been announced has the right to vote! The chair had not completed the announcement. The clerk will call Senator Huyler's name. Mr. Huyler. Mr. Senator Huyler, how say you? Is the respondent, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty? The senator need not rise. My... my vote is pledged. I say... not guilty. You're acquitted, sir. Andrew! Andrew! Thirty-five to 19. Senator Huyler's vote. - Andy! - Mr. President. - Andy. - One vote! Mr. President, congratulations! - Thirty-five to 19! - Huyler decided it. You should have seen Thad Stevens' face! On behalf of President Grant, of the Senate, and of the entire nation, the chair extends welcome to the new senator elect. Before the gentleman from Tennessee is escorted to the bar to take the oath of office, the Senate would welcome a few remarks from the only former President to be elected a member of this body after he left the White House. Mr. President. Senators. My... my fellow Americans. When I last occupied this... this seat in 1861, I was surrounded by empty desks. Now I... I see that they are no longer vacant. Virginia and the Carolinas, Alabama, Louisiana, and... Texas, Mississippi, Florida, Arkansas, and Georgia. You are all back in the fold... as Tennessee stands here in your midst. I... I see as I greet you who sit here about me... that what Lincoln fought for... lived for, and... and died for at long last, has come to pass. The union of these states. One and inseparable. Now and forever.\n"

Hello, I hope you're fine. Thanks. Can I help you? Excuse me, but I wanted to see Mohsen. Mohsen! Come here, my boy. Is there anything? No, thanks. Sorry for disturbing you, bye. I've brought your mother home from the clinic. She must have an operation. I'm going to the city to borrow some money from someone. Take care of your sister Massumeh. Listen to whatever Grandma says. I've given some money to Mr. Ghassem, the grocer. I told him to set aside some milk everyday. I've cut some wood, take it inside after school. Mohsen! Don't forget to get the milk every morning. The doctor said your mother must drink milk. Well, I've got to go. Go back to the class. Father! Can I go duck-hunting? If it doesn't make you tired, go. No, it won't make me tired. Take this in. The doctor said I must have an operation. The operation will be very expensive. God knows what this is. Don't worry. Don't lose heart. God is great. Only the devil is desperate, God is the Healer. Have faith in God. Call me whenever you need any help. Pray to God and ask God to cure my daughter-in-law. I hope she'll get well. When will Mr. Majid come back? I don't know. I didn't want him to go. He's shy. I told him who get you so much money? He said, \"Don't think about it. God is great.\" \"Everything will be O.K. if God wills.\" God is great, He will cure you. Put your faith in God. Massumeh, darling! When did you come? Where's Mohsen? Mohsen is stacking the wood. We've got to go. May God protect you. Don't hesitate to call us if you need any help. God cure you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Grandma, I put the wood in a stack. Well done, my boy! May God keep you safe from harm. Mohsen! Won't you come duck-hunting? You go! I'll come later. Hello! Hello darling! Are you fine? Thanks. Do you want to go out? Father allowed me to go hunting. Can I? What about your homework? You haven't even eaten lunch. I'll take a few pastries and do my homework afterwards. It's cold. You might catch a cold. I'll wear boots. We've got enough till your father returns. I'll sell it and bring the money. O.K., go. He's an ardent boy. He's just like his father. Let the ducks go. There are no ducks today. God knows best, one day he gives, the other he doesn't. Eat! It's good for you. Eat a few spoonfuls. Thanks. You need strength. Won't you? No, thanks. - Mohsen! Did you eat your rice? - Yes. - Want any more? - No. Go and bring some wood. Praise be to Mohammad and his progeny. God! Save her. We've got no one else but you. Massumeh! Have you done your homework? Come! Take the wool. Sweetheart, don't be upset. Mother will get well soon. You're my beauty. Grandma! Can God do everything? Yes, my girl. Everything is in his hands. Can he cure my mother? If God deems advisable, your mother will get well. What does advisable mean? If it's proper, if it's appropriate. What does appropriate mean? It means when the time comes. When will the time come? When you don't tell lies. Say your prayers. Particularly you, children, when you pray. Your mother will get very well. - Grandma! Where is God? - God is everywhere, my girl. He can see and hear everything. If we say something to ourselves, will he hear? Yes, my girl. You pray for sick people, your mother will also get well. - Hello. - Hello, you've got a letter. - I hope it's good news. - Thanks, bye. 1st graders, copy the books. 2nd graders, do your math. - Where are you going? - Shopping. - Can I come too? - No, go home. - Hello. - Hi, Mohsen. How are you? What do you want? - Letter. - A letter. Why do you want it? - To write a letter. - Letter. Oh, paper and envelope? - Yes. - What do you want to do? - I want to write a letter. - For your father? Well, he'll come back soon. Why are you upset? O.K. I'll give you them. You're a good boy. You go to school, don't you? Study a lot. May you become an engineer or a doctor. Here's your paper. Do you want stamps? And here is the stamp. Put the paper in the envelope, stick the stamp. Drop it in the mailbox. It'll find its way. Bye. What are you doing? Come in and close the door. - What are you writing? - A letter. For whom? Won't you tell anyone? - No. - Sure? - For God. - For God? How? I'll write a letter. Stick a stamp. I'll bring it to that road and drop it in the mailbox... ...and it will go to God. What do you write in the letter? Hello God! My name's Mohsen. My sister's is Massumeh. Our mother is very ill. She must go to the hospital, so the doctors will cure her. But they want a lot of money. My father has gone to a city, hoping to bring a lot of money. But if he can't find enough money, my mother won't get well. Everybody said that God can solve all problems... ...and God always cures ill people. Now, Massumeh and I are writing a letter for you... ...to come and take our mother to the hospital. You're very kind. You love children and we love you. If you don't come, we will get so upset and we will cry. We know no one else who can help us but you. We will wait for you in the road of the village everyday... ...so that you will send someone... ...who will come by car to take our mother to the hospital. This was our letter to you. Here! It's here! Oh Abul-Fazl! Oh Fatemeh Zahra! What's wrong, my child? Oh Fatemeh Zahra! Oh Abul-Fazl! Help us! Oh God! We've got no one. Help us, God! Oh Abul-Fazl! Help us! What's wrong, my child? God! Help us. Oh Fatemeh Zahra! Mohsen! Go and tell Mrs. Belgheis to come here. Take this medicine, my girl. Mrs. Belgheis! Mrs. Belgheis! My mother - my mother is very ill. Let's go, my boy! Don't be unhappy, my girl, your mother will get well. You too. Mother will get well. Everything will be alright. You shouldn't be unhappy either. Trust in God. I hope God will repay you. May God prolong your life. You who help everyone. Now, we must pray to God, to make her feel better. By the five Holy ones, I hope she gets well. Why don't you sleep? I don't feel sleepy. When will father come back? I don't know. Mohsen, do you think God has a house in the sky? - Yes. - Where do you think? On the moon. How will the letter get there? It's far away. It's even further than the forests. Grandma said \"God can do everything.\" Do you think that God will read our letter? - Yes. - What will happen next? God will come. - Light the fire for Grandma. - Come back soon. - Hello. - Hello. I've got eggs. Eggs. Twelve tomans each. Eggs. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Postal flowers! - I saw some too. What are these flowers doing here? - I found it at last. - What is it? A letter without any address. Just two names, with a childish handwriting - Mohsen and Massumeh. They probably wanted to play games. What should I do with it? The envelope is open. Perhaps the address is inside. What's the matter? Why are you upset? I don't know what has made Miss Derakhshan so upset. Miss Derakhshan! What's the matter? What's the matter? She was reading a letter, suddenly she started crying. - Please take her to my office. - Alright. Don't be so upset. Do you want something? Mr. Poorseifi, would you please read it out loud? Thanks. Please go back to work. I'll tell you if anything happens. To be honest, up to now... ...I had never felt the presence of God so clearly... ...and I didn't know, God is so close to us. So close that he can show his grandeur... ...in a few sentences written by two children. Our colleagues have decided to find the kid's address. And they want to pay all the hospital's expenses. I envy all of you. They're coming. They're coming. They're coming. Translator: Dina Forouzin\n",
      "Hello Hello! Help! Very good. Now, if that's not the sound of being a man, I'm deaf. We're talking about laying down the damn law and standing up for yourself. It's funny, if I'm going the speed limit, and you're going faster than me, that means you're going above the speed limit. If you're done being nice for no reason, I want you to scream. Chapter five. Let's all chant the word \"balls.\" - Balls, balls, balls. - Balls, balls, balls. Hi. This is Charlotte. Leave a message. Bye. Hi, love. Just want to let you know that I am almost to my new post, which is exciting. Uh, anyway, call me. Would love to hear your voice. You know, or don't. Yeah. Yeah, you don't have to if you don't want to. Actually, no. I would like if you would call me, please. This is me saying what I want, so there. Okay, uh, well, it's Finn. Love you. Call me. Okay, bye. Balls! It's healthy. Balls. Balls. Balls. Balls! Absolutely. Good afternoon to you, as well. Well, if you've got no holes to make, make some now, as the storm is going to be a big one. We're talking about a crippling blizzard. Hi. Where can I find the... Thank you. Now, Mr. Parker, I told you... Well, excuse me, Miss Sherwyn, I told you that I'm here to listen. It's Sherman. See, it's just, I'm worried. Now, this pipeline is a feat of human ingenuity. I mean, look at this. This is plastic, cradled in steel, laying underground in Portland cement. I'll cut you a generous check, easy as a signature. And... What... what is so funny It's just the... It's the irony. I've got an environmentalist staying on the second floor. See, I'm concerned that... Hon, hon, hon, I got environmental guys. I got MIT guys that are smarter than some environmentalist on the second floor, okay They do lots of impact studies, they...

Yeah, I'm going to be stationed in Beaverfield for the duration of construction. - Well, lucky me. - Should it go through. It will. I'm confident. Has to be a majority vote, Mr. Parker. Sure is a lot of beautiful nature here. It'd be a shame to break grounds so close to a national forest. A man that doesn't want to conquer nature doesn't understand how brutal it is, Ranger. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I wasn't trying to be like, \"Oh, it'd be a shame.\" I wasn't trying to make a... May I take your luggage Oh, uh, miss Yeah, uh, Jeanine, you know, I can get that. Nope. Breakfast is 7:00 to 9:00 in the cafe, and then we reopen again at noon. For now, I'm the only game in town, food-wise. Good for business, though, especially with this storm coming. What a night.

Sincerely, Dr. Jane Ellis, PhD, DVM, and professor of zoology, and environmental studies. Room 207.\" Well, ka-ching, I've got a case. - A case. - Yeah, I'm going to head over to this guy, Flint's place.

Yeah, it's pretty sweet, right - Yeah. - I rented a room when I first transferred jobs thinking that I'd eventually get a place in town, but I don't know, two days turned into four weeks, and Jeanine wouldn't let me leave, and so I was like, \"Oh, you want me to help you tidy some rooms in exchange for staying at your sweet-ass mansh\" \"Yes, please.\" - \"Mansh\" - Mansion. - Oh, right. - Want some hot Beaverfield goss Uh, yeah. So Jeanine's husband met a woman at a bar, and, uh, they ran off together. Jeanine hasn't really been the same since. - Dang. - Yeah.

There's something out there! Probably just a coyote. Or a possum, hon. - Those are scary, huh - No! I'm so sorry for your loss, Trish, but everything in these woods eats little dogs. I can't get on the Internet! - Calm down. - What do you think, Dr. Ellis Hi. Uh, it's a little too early to tell, Mrs. Sherman, mainly because I literally don't know what's going on. Hi, everyone. I'm Dr. Ellis. Jane. I'm here to stop the pipeline. A prominent environmentalist who's staying here with us. Oh, Dr. Ellis. I got your... Oh, my God. The power's out, like, everywhere. Oh, no. Our poor Chachi left us this morning. Come here. Oh. Sorry, Trish. I'm sorry, too. Okay, everyone. I'm going to go to town, and I'm going to get the backup generators going, log Chachi's death, and get you back on the Internet. Oh, my goodness. What now - Jeanine. - Yeah You got to let us in. Our shitter's broke. Hey, yo, just so you know that the streets is all storm-fucked. Storm-fucked. What did she just say I think he said... - Storm-fucked. - Yeah. I'll be right back. Oh. Heavens to Betsy. Heavens to Betsy. Huh. What is this Holy sh... Ranger, you look like you just seen a corpse. You're right. Uh... the roads are effed. Yes, we just said that. Yeah, No shit, dummy. We said it. And something's wrong with the generator. Which generator All of them. Wait, what What does that mean It looks like somebody went at them with like a knife. What the hell do you mean, a knife Is that what killed my Chachi Might we put the horror leash away What kind of animal is smart enough to go around town, slashing all the generators, but stupid enough to eat your stupid Chachi Okay, you're over the line, wolf city! Why don't you use your inside voice I'll use whatever voice I want! Maybe I'll use my outside voice! Okay, well, if the power grid is out, it's going to take at least a week for the power to get back up. - A week - Uh, also, there's a dead body under your porch. I didn't want to leave him on the... So I left him on the table. Aw, shit. That's your husband, ain't it Didn't get to Belize after all, huh, Dave Ooh. This is definitely a canine. - How do you know - Probably a wolf. What are you, like, a wolf detective now, Marcus I don't think so. He's right. The leg muscles have been severed. That's how canines immobilize their prey. Accurate assessment for a gas man. Well, I used to do a little brown bear hunting in Siberia. It's a beautiful animal. Yo, lady, you a wolf detective, though Really good, Marcus. Close, no. She studies animals. No, thanks. Teetotaler. Suit yourself. Well, I'd, I'd take some if you'd be so kind. I would be. What happened to Dave It's just so awful. Anyway, um, lady doctor, do you think what got Dave also got my Chachi If you'll excuse me, I need to go compare these fur samples. Peter. He don't stink 'cause he froze up. Maybe we should just take it inside. - Yeah. - It's so disgusting. Now one body, there's two bodies. You know, nothing's gonna get down that mountain but a snowplow. Does Beaverfield have a snowplow Fuck yeah, we do. Good. I just need that starter and fuel injector I ordered. Oh. Oh, there's a wild animal out there, and I don't want to say it out loud, but who knows who or when it's going to kill next. Or when she's going to kill next. I do not find that funny. - Hey, hey, hey. - It's a little funny. I have an idea. This Flint guy, he's an expert hunter, right - Oh, yeah. - You could say that. Well, maybe we pay him a visit. And kill the damn thing Actually, I was going to say, maybe h-h-he can trap it You can't go by yourself, man. That psycho, he's nuts. - You could come with me. - No, I'm good. - Anyone else - We're trying to have a baby. And my husband is dead. And Chachi, also. Cecily He can probably only eat one of us at a time. Uh... You know, if we had some snowshoes, we'd be killing this walk right about now. We get it, you love snowshoes. Yeah. Thanks for coming with me. It's really... It's really cool of you. Cool Is it cool of me, like, a friend way cool of me, or is it cool of me in like a girl you almost make out with, but then don't because your ex-girlfriend calls, cool of me way - Look, last night... - No, Finn, it's fine. You're not over your ex. Let's not make a thing out of it. Well, no, you're wrong. You know Last night was very, very big for me. In like a sad way 'cause you're with the wrong girl No, look. Because I was with the right girl. One who's smart and beautiful. True. And interesting. I'm listening. Look, I blew it, okay There's no denying that. And it's not because I love Charlotte still. It's because I don't... I don't know why. Finn, you're a really likable guy, and that's great. A lot of people like you. Not to sound too heteronormative, but maybe Charlotte's right. Maybe you should man up, you know Grow a beard, hair on your chest, chug a beer, yell at someone smaller than you. I don't know, yell things like, \"Respect me.\" I don't know what men do. I try not to hang out with them too much. You do realize that we are prepared to double the offer I don't care if you triple the offer. We moved up here for scenery, not your construction scheme. No. And scenery requires having a forest, which you don't eff up. Well, you're really effing up our people's dreams. Yeah, well, too bad, Pete. Shit, I guess Trish don't get her craft store, huh Craft store What about our freaking money - I don't know. - Go ask. Ask! Yo, Parker, so Gwen and I, we want money. Oh, sorry, Marcus, if the vote ain't unanimous, no one gets nothing, unless you can convince your neighbors otherwise. Are you deaf We are not going to sell. - Sorry, neighbors. - You suck. - You both suck. - I suck You don't belong here! You're liberal snowflakes. Y'all city slickers suck. Yeah You got everything you, um, need, Doctor Dr. Ellis, do I call you Doctor or Dr. Jane or... Jeanine, I have everything I need. Thank you so much for letting me set up shop in here. Okay. You got enough power Yep. I work in the woods. I've got some batteries. Okay, okay. Oh. - Jeanine - Okay. I'm going to find out what killed your dead husband. I have excellent samples, and I'm going to get answers for you. Uh, okay. Do you want me to knock or... No, I got it. - Are you scared - No. - 'Cause I can hear your tummy. - I'm not. Are you No, I'm punk. Okay. Wait, you're in a punk band I was, actually, in high school, yeah. We were called Megalodons 'cause our lead singer's name was Meg. - That's so cool! - I know. I played... Either of you care to illuminate what the hell happened to my generator Uh, so... in conclusion, what we're asking is that you track this thing down and... Kill it Hm. No. Okay. Thank you for your time. You've made yourself perfectly clear. We're just going to get out of your beard. Mr. Flint, I understand that you're proud of being tucked away in the outskirts of this town, but, you know, you're still a part of this town. This thing is killing people in the place where you live, and the people of this town, everybody's going, \"How the... How the heck are we going to get rid of this monster\" And you know what Everybody, every single one of them, they all voted for you. - It was really led by you. - Cecily. Don't touch that, please. Mr. Flint, Emerson. Emerson Flint. People are afraid, and, you know, no matter what their differences are, people deserve to feel safe. I guess what we're asking is that you... you be a good neighbor, you know, like Mr. Rogers. Hey, I love him. - Yeah. - Mr. Rogers, huh Yeah. Who's that - Hmm - Hmm It was all Jeanine's story, you know, Dave running off and whatnot. Welcome to Beaverfield. Population, bunch of liars. What are you suggesting, Mrs. Anderton Pete, you and Dave were tight. Did he ever say anything about going to Belize Nope, but you know what's weird Jeanine's against your pipeline, Mr. Parker, but Dave was really excited about it. - Mm-hmm. - Huh. Wait, y'all aren't saying that... We just don't know for sure now, do we Shit. You know what I can't get out of my head - Language. - Tell me. Come on. All of the generators are just conveniently mangled by some animal - Fuck off. - Language. Somebody did this, a legitimately maladjusted somebody. Mm, I don't know. Dr. Ellis did say it was an animal. I mean, there was all those hairs. Mm. Well, we definitely have some unknown knowns and some known unknowns. What's known is that animals don't sabotage generators, but guess what is covered in hair and totally can A werewolf! No. No. Again, I wasn't... I wasn't going to say that. I was going to say... Emerson Flint. \"It's a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,\" King Friday. He plays with puppets. You know What is it The Land of Make Believe I don't think so. Mr. Flint, I'm convinced this thing is going to kill again, and... Finn. Chachi. Oh, my God. I know, I know. I'm not your man. Get out. Understood. Uh... You know, we're probably just going to head back to the inn, you know, save some lives. - Make a soup. - Mm-hmm. I'd die for one of Jeanine's sandwiches. I don't want to die. I don't want to die either. - That would be be terrible. - Good night. Oh, gosh. - Just push. - Is it jammed You want to leave - Uh... - It's fine. It's not opening. I'm going in both directions. You go ahead, please. No, spare me. Oh, please don't. Oh, please! - Please don't bother the lock. - Spare me there. Oh, my goodness. I could have gotten that myself. But I appreciate it. He's definitely the murderer. Keep your voice down, be normal. Hurry! I need warmth. - What happened - TRISHA: What did he say Emerson killed Chachi. What Hold on a minute. We don't know that for sure, Cecily. Does that mean he killed Dave Does that mean he killed my husband What are you talking about He had Chachi's collar. She does this a lot. No! That's my child. That bastard did it! - Okay, okay! Shh! It's all right. It's all right. She's just happy to have some closure, and now we finally got it. It's Emerson. Chachi just got his wings. - Dave, too. - Sorry, Trish. Hey, Jeanine, what do you say we open up a nice bottle of wine, huh - No! - Okay. Oh! Uh... Uh, okay. - Well, maybe not that one, Pete. - You want some, Gwen You're not one to turn away a spicy rat. Why you fucking touch my ass - Whoa, okay. - Keep your hands to yourself, or I'll cut them the fuck off. Must be that time of the day. Don't touch my wife's ass. Can I make anybody a sandwich - I'll take one. - No, you won't. Me, I want one. Oh, my God, that was an absolutely horrible sound you made. Dr. Ellis, are you okay Did you find the answers now That was fast. I compared the DNA samples. The hairs from both Dave's body and Chachi's little outfit are a match. Everything about this predator is unorthodox. It's not human. It's canine, but there are no matches in the database. I'm going to keep running tests, but for now, what I can tell you is I don't know what this thing is. Examining the body, it appears it feeds like a dog or a wolf, meaning... Meaning that I want to know. Meaning Dave was probably eaten alive. That's fucking rad. - Okay. Everyone, hey. Everyone, hey, can I have your attention, please Between the power outages and the storm, the whole Emerson thing, I think we can all agree that it's unsafe outside and there's safety in numbers. - So maybe we... - We should stay here tonight. I'm with you, yeah. I don't want to go out and get ate. - Same. - Same. Jeanine, you got room. You can put us all up, can't you No. It's just that... Well, I have... Thank you so much, Jeanine. But some people would have to double up. Well, I mean, I think that'd be fine, right, Cecily Okay. Slow down. Uh, out of curiosity, who is packing I am, yes, sir, America. Shit. Well, we're packing, dawg. I have Dave's hunting rifle if that would be helpful. Oh, gosh. I almost forgot. Um... I got... It's teensy. It's a purse gun. - Excuse you. - Okay. You know, I think we should keep a gun in every room, you know, just to be safe. Hold up! This dude Emerson wants to come down off his mountain-maniac ass and eat our asses and fuck our skulls, guess what It's not going to happen tonight because pam, pam, I'm up in this tit. Yeah. Where my gun goes, I goes. Same, and I am sleeping with my wife unless someone prefers that my gun stays in someone else's room. Cecily, do you want protection or... - I'm good. - Thank you. Uh, one more time, raise your hand if you have a gun. It's tiny. It's a purse gun. And if you don't have a gun, no gun Marcus got my gun. Welp, we're having a good, old-fashioned sleep over. - With guns, though. - With guns, yes. Dr. Ellis We just thought we'd clue you in on the game plan for tonight. Professor You all right I'm fine. I just need more time. To work. Okay. All right, everyone, let's lock up. What the fuck is going... Peter! Peter! - We need more lights. - Oh, my God! Can someone please look for my hand Hell, yeah. I got you, bro. You shot my husband. - His hand has been bitten off! - Oh, my God! For God's sakes, this is an animal attack. Uh, no, I think he was shot, too. Oh, wow, would you look at that - Okay, Peter. - He's just in shock. I stopped the bleeding. He should be okay. We would have heard him come in. How many times did you fire your piece How many times do you ask stupid questions Guys, it was obviously an accident. Accident or not, we're obviously not safe We need help. Is he here He didn't just disappear. Dr. Ellis Dr. Ellis, are you okay Gwen, what was it Did you see it Didn't get a good look. He was fast. We need to get him to a hospital. We can't go anywhere until the storm blows over. Marcus, don't touch that, please. I didn't. I wasn't. I feel like I'm in one of those dinner theater murder things and I'm having a horrible time, and I can't go home. I don't get it. All right, babe, it's a nightmare. What could have gotten in here And how did it get in here How did it get out Who says it got out Okay. It's not possible. It's not possible. It's not possible. It's not possible. Did you find the answers now That was fast. No! No! It's not human. It's canine, but there were no matches in the database. Does that mean he killed Dave Does that mean he killed my husband I have excellent samples, keeping the root alive. I'm going to get answers for you. Dr. Ellis I told you, she's probably tanked. Touch this door again, I'll shoot... again. Dr. Ellis Please. Look, we need answers. It didn't disappear. What did she say What It's not Emerson Flint. It's one of you. What the hell is that supposed to mean Okay, well, we don't understand. Can you just please come out I'm afraid I can't do that, Ranger Wheeler. You could be one of them. - What is she... - Shh, shh, shh. One of what A lycanthrope. - A what - Lycanthrope A werewolf. What What is this, dumbass island She's drunk. She's a dumbass island, baby, you're fucking... - Shh! - This room got a back door Uh, yeah. Yeah. Listen, hey, Dr. Ellis I know you're freaked out. Now I'm freaked out. I think we're all freaked out, yeah Yeah. We're freaked out. But tell you what, if you come out, we can all discuss this together as a group. Hey! Parker, no. Stay back. - Put the gun down. - Stay back! No! Dr. Ellis, are you okay She killed herself. - Oh, my God. - What Wait. What She killed herself She was less afraid of death than whatever happened to Dave. All right, we searched again. Doors, windows, everything's locked. Nobody in here but us, for better or worse, y'all. And remember, nobody's calling the cops. Everyone shut your stupid whore mouths and listen to this, \"Complete set of humanoid DNA overlaps with a complete set of canine DNA.\" Blah, blah, blah, boring, boring, boring. Oh, \"Not sure if this is another species or evolution.\" Well, it's not one of those things. Hey, though, real My dead dad did tell me an old folklore about the settlers that used to run the werewolves out of the woods. Okay. Why are we even talking about werewolves - Why not - Werewolves Every culture's got a werewolf story. That's true. The Vikings had the ulfhednar, the Turkey has Kurd Adan. Okay, big daddy Sam Parker dropping that werewolf knowledge. When I was a kid, my daddy used to kick my ass. Okay. He also used to tell me about the Wendigo. He said he was coming to get me if I was acting like a little shit. - What's a Wendigo - It's a man-beast. Stalks the woods, hungers for human flesh, but is never full. That's funny. That sounds like a euphemism for white men. You're funny, honey. Thanks, baby. You know, growing up in Argentina, it wasn't uncommon for the seventh-born child to be killed because that one's a werewolf. But you don't do that anymore, right, because that's crazy I think I know what this is. Somebody is trying to scare us, so cut the werewolf crap. One of you in this house is a bully and a murderer. Somebody is trying to take money from honest, God-fearing, hardworking people. One of you would rather terrorize us than let Mr. Parker build his harmless pipeline. - Oh, Jesus. - One of you killed my dog. One of you ate my husband's hand, and for what To save some chipmunks Trish, they tried to frack up here, and they log. Oh, Janine, shove it. It's no different than fracking. You need to listen to her. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. You can't just buy people, Mr. Parker. Okay, we can't say that, okay, baby We have money, honey. Okay Who are we to tell these people they can't take a check That's exactly right. Somebody's terrorizing us to steal our damn money. Hey, we're talking low-impact construction here, people. I don't let people fuck with my money. That's what I don't do. Y'all suck! Are we really in a Mexican stand off right now Baby, don't say Mexican, just stand off. So who's the bully Okay. Hey, everyone. Everyone, please. We've got a suicide on our hands. - You got little hands, bitch. - And my husband is dead. - I don't have little hands. - Stop saying hands. - Pete's missing a hand. - I'm missing a hand - And my husband is dead. - And also Chachi. Hey, look, I know tensions are high, clearly, but can we all agree to lock our guns away until we can figure this out Even you, Ranger Yeah. Yes. Even me. Even though that defies all protocol, sure, you know, when... when werewolves are within the house. You got a point. I mean, if Dr. Ellis is right, any one of us could be a suspect. I say we put our heads together and smoke the fucker out. You're smart. You're so smart. Shit, y'all. Hey, Trish has the most motive here, I think. - What - Yeah. You hated Pete ever since my girl Gwen fucked him. I'm missing a hand. First of all, that was four years ago. And also, it never happened. This conversation is foul. Why would I even bite off Pete's hand - That's... - Payback. - Well, what... - And you, you said you were going to cut off his head. You actually said it. Why don't you just admit it - What - You're husband's a creep. You're a creep. You're the creep. Fine. No, I'm not a creep. I'm a werewolf. Maybe you're a werewolf. You're a werewolf, you're a werewolf, you're a werewolf, maybe we're all werewolves! Maybe I ate my own hand! Ow! You didn't eat your own hand, hon. Uh, okay. Yeah, look, maybe we're just a little on edge. Frankly, I'm a bit on edge about Mrs. Sherwood. - Yeah - Oh, my goodness. It's Sherman. Yeah, well, Mr. Sher-man was in favor of the pipeline coming through this stinky old inn now, wasn't he - That's right. - It's not stinky. Your husband wanted to sell, and your story about him is suspect. That's right. That's right. That's right. Don't go easy on her, Mr. Parker, because, you know, you forget that we found her dang husband's body underneath her own dang house. - Right. - If I could just say - one thing... - You know, I'm sitting here, and quite honestly, I'm just gob smacked. Oh, you're gob smacked By of the accusations that are flying around this room! You know, I didn't kill my damn husband. And I'm not a damn \"lycantrope,\" whatever. - Lycanthrope. - Well, whatever, I am not one of those! I'm not a cockamamie wolf. I didn't kill my husband. Dave said he left me because... ...I let myself go. That's crazy. - You look so, so good. - You have clothes. I'm so sorry. It's a bit of a reach. Is that why you ate him - Uh, if I could just say one... - What about you Mr. Parker Aren't we suspicious of him How do we know you didn't kill Dr. Ellis Why am I the only one bringing that up Am I the only one that finds that suspicious The gun was in her hand, hon. You gave her your flask. She didn't want your damn booze. This man, he is a newcomer. He wants our land. He's trying to buy us out with all his money. - What's wrong with that - Let me just say one thing. What about Ranger Wheeler here, and Cecily - I mean, they're newcomers. - Oh, whatever! We're innocent A.F., and you know it! We blindly walked into this weird-ass horror show of a town! Yes, sticking your nose in these people's business with your money and your fancy booze. All right, I'll say it again, lady! You are a dangerous man. That was Royal Crown Derby. Look, I know it's easy to get caught up in the fear of the situation, but can we all just take a breath and remember what we wanted out of this community when we moved here Yeah, like... like you, Trish. What I mean, we know that you're devastated by Chachi. Yeah, I am. It really sucks. But you made us all those... Soap bottle angels. Yeah, those. And I mean, I don't know about anybody else, but that made me feel amazing. I still keep mine on the mantel. Yeah, to my dismay. And, Devon, look, I know you feel that everything bad came in with Parker, but, you know, some of your neighbors aren't tech millionaires. You know, a little extra money would mean a lot of them. Well, we're not actually millionaires. Well... - Are we - Maybe. - Oh. - Yeah, we're rich. And, Janine, you've been so generous in spite of all your grief. I know it's easy to point the finger and fear each other. At its heart, this is a community, you know, one that agrees about more than it doesn't. You know, hard work. Be a good neighbor. Warm place to meet, have a sandwich. Love. All I'm asking is that we remember our common... our common humanity. And we just hold off on being enemies till we've all had a little sleep. Fuck that noise. I saw what happened to Pete, and I saw what happened to Dave, and I'm not gonna stick around and let that happen to me and Marcus. - Let's go, Marcus. - Hell yeah. It's safer out there than it is in this hellhole. Fuck your house. So I hope y'all dildos get eaten by a wolf. Okay. Well, this is where I also go my own way. I had just about enough of this town. Once again, fear and intolerance has reared its ugly head. We are going to wait this out at home. Or at least until the cops get here. Say goodbye to your stupid craft store, Trish. Oh, okay. Petey boy, let's get you home, hon. Come on, come on. They're gonna get theirs, hon. They'll get theirs. They'll get what's coming. They'll get what they deserve. Hey. How are you going to protect yourself Oh, uh, got my trusty bear spray. Okay, good. Yeah. All right. Oh! There's something in Parker's room. I'm sorry! Oh, God. What now Janine, just, uh, go to your room, lock your door. Don't come out for anybody, okay Okay. I thought he left. Me too. Looks like Parker left that window open. Hey, Finn. Yeah Did you say you were at Grout Pond and Townshend Yeah. Why Are you seriously giving me the silent treatment right now You seriously want to go back to that chicken shit madhouse with those people Oh, well, I'm sorry, babe, but sue me, okay You know what they say, safety in numbers. Yeah, more like not safety in numbers. - What was that - It's okay. It's okay. We're okay. Watch your step. Who's there Who's there Who is that Let's go. Hey, Cec. What's that smell like Diesel. - The generators. - The generators. This isn't funny! Hey, stop fucking with us. I'll fuck you up so hard! Baby, let's go. Let's go. Shh. Wait a minute. What the heck is this about Oh, my God. What Townshend, Grout Pond, Beaverfield. Joaquim! Parker's tracking the attacks. Oh, shit. I'm going to go check the barricade. What was that You I know, hon. Trish. What the fuck Maple tap. It's where the sweet stuff comes out. What I want my craft store. Hey! You're probably a bit confused. And why is this gas guy wearing a bunch of fancy hunting gear I always hunted as a hobby, but when Ellis said one of you could be a lycanthrope, a werewolf... well, news of this predator around the state suddenly made a whole lot of sense. - Are you okay - Yeah. - Are you - Yeah. Hi. Why is that Parker dressed like a scary cowboy I think I just pissed my pants. Sorry. We were being chased, and then we got separated from each other, but then... Wait, are you guys... Why are you guys hiding Parker thinks he's hunting werewolves. He sabotaged the generator. - Where's Devon - I don't know. We were... we were together, and then we got separated, and then I got lost, and then something's out there. Something's out there, I think. I think it got him. Where was this It was by Trish's house. If I know Devon, he probably came here for safety, so he's probably in here, right - Devon - CECILY: Ssh! What are you doing Oh, yeah, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry, I won't do that. Devon, baby! - Ssh! - Joaquim, stop! - Devon! Baby, is that you - FINN: Hey, wait. Baby. Boy, you just had to be strong. Now you're dead. But... Marcus Marcus, what the hell are you doing - What are you doing - What am I doing That's easy, Ranger, what am I doing I taped... I taped knives to my hands, and then underneath, it's just my hand, but it's deadly with the knives on it. And I'm going to steal everybody's shit, and then I'm going to make it look like a werewolf did it. Well, if you end up being the werewolf, that's a big fucking disappointment. Right Okay, Marcus, I see you have some knives. Back off! - That's my work shirt. Stay back! Stay back! Maybe I'm the werewolf, maybe you became the werewolf. Weren't you a werewolf part-time, motherfucker Weren't you a werewolf I'm the full-time werewolf, bitch. Is there even a werewolf I don't know! I don't have to answer your questions, bitch. You little bitches can't catch a cold. I said, don't see you, don't want to be you, now, little punk. You guys probably are so dead right now 'cause I'm your only friend, really, if you think about it. Don't get eaten. - Marcus, let's go, brainless! Got you, home wrecker. Yeah, this town's bat shit. Let's go inside, out the back. Let's go out the back, please. She still has her tiny BB gun! Fucking bitch. That's very rude. My house, you're trespassing. Trespassers will be shot on command, they will be shot on sight. No. Oh, I know another way in. Nobody move. - What is she, Michael Myers - What Wipe your feet. See, clean. Wiped. Super, they're so clean, right Listen, back up! Just keep moving back. Come on. - Watch where you're going. - Hey. Happy family, line up, line up. You people do not belong here. You don't belong in this town, in this house, and you sure as Shinola don't get to tell me what to do with my property! Trish, did you do something to my husband Did you kill Devon Oh, I don't care what you do in your own home. Your little husband should have kept his nose in his own beeswax, and you all should've let Mr. Parker build his pipe... Peter! What did you do Peter, no. You killed Peter. You killed my husband. Is she okay She's okay. Trish Let's leave, please. Okay, okay, Ranger, put on your ranger hat. - What are we doing - All right. Well, we're going to take Marcus' truck. - Okay. - Go as far as we can, uh, you know, maybe fi... Ugh! Sorry, Marcus. - Sorry, Marcus. - And find some snowshoes, and get the heck off this mountain. Dude loves snowshoes. Well, it's the oldest, most effective means of traversing ice and snow... - Oh, God! - Is that... Parker. Why is he you hunting Why are you hunting us Ssh! I don't know. You know Cec was the youngest of seven. You guys are blocking his pipeline. And I'm the pain in the ass sent to give him a hard time. So he could be hunting any of us. But it's not any of us, 'cause none of us has seen any actual evidence of a werewolf. - Finn. - No, yeah, good point. Ellis was taking all those hair samples with that machine thing. I mean, science, am I right It's just, something doesn't add up. Joaquim, what are you doing, man She's a seventh born. I mean you said it your goddamn self, Ranger, didn't you Okay We're not crazy. Okay. We're not crazy! - Kinda! - No, we're not, okay! You're the fucking werewolf! Okay She's the werewolf, okay So we have to... Please put the gun down, okay I can't, okay I can't! Because I live in Argentina, the seventh born is a werewolf! - It's just superstition! - Shut the fuck up, girl! I love you so much. I have to kill your ass! I know it's been a long, long day. I know, right Maybe just put the gun down because... Ow. Finn, what do we do What do we do now Okay. Start the truck. Finn, it won't start! - Try again! - I'm fucking trying! Let's go, darling. Fight me, come on. Family of four, mauled to death in Townshend. Couple of college kids mangled in Grout Pond, all around the same time that you were there. Then you came to Beaverfield. Yeah, you put yourself in charge, you discovered Dave. Now that's a... that's a bit obvious, don't you think there, Ranger Finn, what is he talking about Come on, Cec. He sabotaged the generator. No, that was you, Ranger. See, I found a diesel-drenched knife in your room. I... We found that in your room. It's not possible. I don't know what to believe. You pitted this community against itself with your promises, your money. You brought out the worst in these people. There's no animal on a killing spree. There's no monster. The only monster here is you. Maybe you're right. But better safe than sorry. No! - Finn! - Cecily, are you okay Finn, look out! Finn! Finn! Eat some silver! Yes! Yes! Finn! Get up! Finn! Excuse me, Mr. Parker. Your pipeline is trash. Fuck. That was really fucked up. Yeah. Yeah, it was. Hmm. Power's back. Ooh. Well, that's not good. Oh, my God, Finn. Okay, come on, we got to get you inside, let's go, let's go. Come on. Come on. Oh. Oh, this is much worse than I thought. Yeah, it's pretty bad. You know what I'm gonna go get the first aid kit, okay Okay, I'm dying, I think. No, you're not going to die. You're not going to die. Hey, can you promise me that you're not going to die 'Cause it would probably traumatize me for the rest of my life. And also, 'cause I, um... I really like you, and I, um... I'm very grateful that you saved my life. So you're not going to die, okay Okay Okay, Say, \"okay.\" - Okay. - Say, okay. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, I'm going to see if the phones are back up. You know, nothing's going to get down that mountain but a snowplow. Just need that starter fuel injector I ordered. It's you, isn't it Were you even in a punk band Yeah. We just didn't actually break up, though. - You ate them. - I ate them. Yeah. Oh, come on, Finn, didn't I seem a little too good to be true No. You seemed great. Oh, no, Finn, help me. What do we do now The car won't start! Finn, Sam Parker has me by the hair. That... That's great Don't yell at me. That's not yelling. That's taking a tone. This is yelling. You're really a... Werewolf. Yeah. Werewolves are real. Women who read \"Walden\" while drinking kombucha and getting turned on by your Yellowstone stories, they're a fantasy. Hello You killed Dave. I needed an outfit. There can only be one postal worker. It was really a districting thing. You ate Trish's dog. My baby! And you ate Pete, his hand. I was attacked! Some men do this thing when they want to \"guide you,\" where they put their hand on your lower back. I hate that. Cecily, the mailman. No, thank you. Should've bitten off both hands. Why couldn't you just, like, hunt Which is a brilliant idea. You think I didn't try that I did. It was exhausting. But Beaverfield is perfect. There's lots of festering resentments, made all the spicier way by this pipeline drama. I don't let people fuck with my money! All I had to do was plant a tiny little doggy's collar. Emerson killed Chachi. Spread a couple of rumors. I found a diesel-drenched knife in your room. Everyone else just took care of themselves with their fear and greed and their own petty nature. I mean, I'm going to eat them later, and I knew there'd be that snowstorm but that road blockage, mm, baby, just... Hmm. You almost blew up my shit, though, you know that, right I kept trying to turn you into one of them, but you're pathological. And what is my pathology exactly You're too fucking nice with your Kumbaya speeches and your small town, \"Gee, golly goodness.\" Blow me. This town is full of two-faced assholes, and you know it. You're a monster. Girl's got to eat, and I got dinner on ice until spring. What You mock me for being nice. This whole time, you've been mocking me for being nice. But you know what I got to tell you, I'm a nice person, all right I'm considerate. I'm compassionate. I care. People want me to change, but there's nothing wrong with me. I'm a nice person who wants to do nice things for other people and have nice people do things for other people. You know Sorry, I got to tell you, it's fucking okay to be nice. Pardon my language. It's effing okay to be nice. How's that for... for, you know, Kumbaya bullshit Well, in a dog-eat-dog world, you could be nice, or you could be me. Heavens. Oh, fuck. Cecily Emerson, what are you doing here Being a good neighbor, you know, like Mr. Rogers. I just... Oh! Oh, no! I saw the sign And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign Wolves. Aaah! Aaah! Hey, all right! Whoa! Aaah! What What Flint Give me a hand, will you Thanks. You all right You saved my life. Yeah, well. I like what you said back in my cabin about, uh, community. That was, uh, nice. You hungry Starving. You think Jeanine's still alive Maybe. She could make us a sandwich. Make your own damn sandwich. Emerson Flint.\n"

      "THE BLUE LIGHT Good day Mister. Greetings. Can we stay here tonight? Tomorrow we would like to go to Monte Christallo. Who is this person Junta? Junta? Ernst, come in. Bring the book here, it is about Junta. Horst, it is now the right time to read about the Blue Light on the mountain. Did Junta really live? Have we arrived? Does this road lead to Santa Maria? Hey Sir... Is he mute or doesn't he understand German? Bye... bye... I am the hotel manager of Santa Maria. Thank God, finally somebody who speaks German. Did you come to pick me up? Yes. What are these strange sculptures? These are the boys of the village who fell off the mountain. That's my son. You are not very joyful here. It's a full moon, a bad day for Santa Maria. What does that have to do with the moon? A curse on our village since the big flow that came down from the Monte Christallo. When it is full moon, there is a blue light shining on the rock. Each time the young boys want to go up and each time... and each time one cross more. I planted a cross for my youngest son. Tonto! Tonto! Why are you so against that girl? - She is not normal. How can she climb towards the blue light... on the steep side of the mountain... while the young boys fall down every time? This Junta, she's the damned devil's witch. Do not close the shutters, it's such nice weather. It's a full moon. Yes, the blue light... My son, six months ago, he was the fourth victim this year. Silvio! Silvio! Silvio! There she is, the devil's witch. Damm you! It's all her fault, it's her fault. Stop! Guzzi! Guzzi! Guzzi! Guzzi! Guzzi... Guzzi! Junta! I'm here, I'm here. Hey, what's the matter? Have some eat. I was on the street, early this morning. All of a sudden I saw a crowd in front of Maria's house. I heard Maria, who shouted: \"Junta, Junta!\". I was afraid and ran away... then I saw the threatening crowd. They ran after me with sticks... they threatened me with their fists and they shouted: \"Aaaa, aaaaa.\" They threw stones at me, I was running but they came nearer and nearer. Then a man jumped from a window, he stood there with his arm like this and shouted: \"Stop!\". Junta, where are you? Junta, Junta. Junta! Junta! Hi! Hello. What do you have there? Is that milk? Hey. It's very nice here. I'd like to stay here. Now I must go. I want to leave here before it gets dark, but I will come again. Tomorrow, I will come again. For sure. So... See you again. Junta, see you again. I wanted to say something Tomorrow, I'll go back to the mountains. I might stay over there for a few days, so do not get worried. Junta! Junta... Junta! Good day Sir. So Junta, here I am again. And this is a small contribution for our life in common. This is bread. -Bread. I know. Cheese. -How nice, how nice. But where shall I sleep? I guess you sleep there and the little boy over there. And me? Sleeping? - To sleep? -To sleep! I understand, I understand. But where? There... you can sleep here. You'll sleep very well. Junta, little witch, you make me behave like a fool. If only we could speak with each other it would be perfect. I have been here for many weeks now and... I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'll not go back ever back to the people. Junta, Junta, what's happen ing with you? Junta, little Junta. What? Junta, Junta, what's happening with you? Come and show me what you brought from the village. Let's have a look. Junta. Junta. Junta, my little Junta. How can I explain it to you, you cannot understand me. -What's the matter? Those crystals, they are a danger for you and for the whole village. But they could be a blessing. The peasants should be told about it. Let me go now. Don't go. Stay. Stay with me. It's a real treasure, it must be found and brought to the village. You'll never have to run around in these rag clothes anymore. I'll come back. Very soon I'll come back. See you! It's not here, that you should climb. But here, at this side till those rocks. And then, do not climb there, but here, and you will find the entrance to the grotto. We understand. Goodnight. Junta. Junta! Junta! That's how the poor Junta of Santa Maria died. But her memory lives on in the village, the people who persecuted her so much they got rich with the stones of the Monte Christallo. End of the story of Junta.\n",
      "That's what they said in the old country. And then look what happened. Marv, he's powerful, he's famous. Then he goes down. That's how life is. There's always been a neighborhood on Coventry Street. You had vegetable stands, bakeries, kosher chicken market. And for 28 years, you want a blintz and a cup of coffee? Marv's was the place to go. Only place after eight at night. But then one day the young kids moved in. The hippies come and they do their thing. The curious just watched, the pessimists Most of 'em were good. Some not so good, but what can I say? They were different. Yeah, that's it Fuck you and fuck this place! Just about every gal on Coventry Street had worked at Marv's. Sooner or later, they all walk away. What happened to Sally? Turnover was so high because well, Marv just couldn't stay away from the waitresses. Only Sylvia had stuck it out. Will you people ever see that uniform again? What do you want from me, Gracie? We needed help, I hired a waitress. I got your chickens. Ah. What are these for? These are for my new sandwich, the Miraculous Marvel, one bite of this thing and they're gonna line the streets. That's what you said about the dough maker. That was different. Don't listen to her. Take these to the kitchen and I'll give you a check. Mr. Grunfield said that I should only take cash. What? He said that your checks was only good for wiping your tuchus with. He said that about me? God damn trader. You know, if it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have a business. He'll still be picking How Marv stayed in business was a mystery. It seemed that whenever he made, he'd spend on the horses. For God sakes, Gracie, my old cousin. I gave him his start and this is how he treats me? You'll see. Tell your uncle I'll be giving him checks and I don't care what he does with 'em. So we're going up to her place. I should have known from the moment that I was on the stairway that I was in for an unusual evening. Then one thing leads to another, hanky panky, heavy pet, the clothes are coming off. There we are stark naked. You know what she says to me? Grunfield won't take Marv's checks. Nah, she says, Grunfield? What's Grunfield got to do with it? Where was I? Oh yeah, she says, I like to wrestle naked. Then before I have a chance to ask Oh, I forgot to mention, me, Morty and Yosha were Marv's steadiest customers. She's naked. What's that? It's for Marv. I didn't finish filling in the G. I ran out of green pen. Can't I ever finished a story around here without being interrupted? I wasn't interrupting. You asked me what it is. - What'd you charge him? - I gave him a bargain. Why do you let him penny pinch you like that? He's not penny pinching me. I just gave him a bargain. What do you think? What's that supposed to mean? You can't afford the lox, you're not welcome? That's a classism, man. He has to run a business. Oh, he's doing plenty of business. Look at him. All the food he shoves in his belly could feed a hundred starving children in Bangladesh. It doesn't matter what he puts in his belly. Grunfield won't take his checks anymore. That doesn't mean you have to let him penny pinch you like that. He's not penny pinching me. I just gave him a bargain. Oh, so you gave him a bargain and we sit here for an hour waiting for a lousy cup of coffee? That's how it is. First goes the coffee, then the corned beef, then they take away the business. Susan Bennett was new to Cleveland. Her first time away from home. It's a fast track so give me Hot Tamale in the fifth at Santa Anita. Give me Lefty in the third at Hialeah and Cleopatra in the third at Pimlico. A century note on each. You got that? Yeah. I wanted to see about getting a job here. Got any restaurant experience? The Dairy Barn. You good with people? I don't know. Yeah, I guess so. You went to school? College, I'm a freshman. Ah, college girl, huh? You know, all my kid brothers went to college, one of them is a doctor now. Head of gastro. Oh. So about the job? Yeah, sure, you can start tonight. She can't work in those clothes. You take care of it. The ceiling's leaking again. Do you have a skirt and a plain blouse? Well, it's almost plain. It'll do, just change and hurry back. Your shift started an hour ago. I don't believe this. Lenny re-plastered this last week. I let him eat here a whole week for free. It ain't the plaster that's your problem. It's the people upstairs. They got a swimming pool up there or something. Why don't you have Horowitz do something about this? He won't do anything. Maybe if you paid the rent he would. Why do you think I don't pay it? He never does anything. That does it. Why did you hire that girl? We needed somebody. But I'm supposed to do the hiring. So I hired her, you train her. - Hey. - Alright. How come he always has food? He knows how to behave himself. Hey, what about us, huh? Susan had an apartment right down the alley from Marv's with Faith, a girl she knew from back home. It must have been nice for Susan to have a friend in such a strange new place. Do you have a plain blouse? I'm working at Marv's. How about my white halter top? How about just going in your undies? Excuse me, what do you want me to do? If you had not taken your sweet old time coming back there would have been time to train. - I'm sorry. - See this pad? That's your station. Go take orders. What's up, man? I'm gonna take two bagels, extra jam. Make it strawberry jam. Is that everything? No, hold on. Hot beef tongue and eggs? Waitress! What's she doing over there, shooting craps? Do you want me to come back later? No, hold on a second. Okay, if you're getting beef tongue then I'm going to get blitzes. Okay, make it three blueberry blintzes, side of sour cream, make it two sides of sour cream. - Blueberry? - Blintzes. And don't forget the sour cream. Waitress, huh? How are you? Oh, I love these, this is your color. Do you believe in love at first sight or should I walk by again? You look great. I ordered a cheese blintz, not a blueberry blintz. I don't even eat blueberries, I'm allergic to 'em. Sorry, I'm not sure what happened. - Morty, shush. - Don't shush me! We've been waiting 40 minutes, she's trying to poison me with blueberries. No, you understand, there's no cheese. Waitress! I'm not paying that bill. Waitress! No, she had no cheese on the sandwich and you gotta fix this now. Sandwich, no cheese. Nice haircut, Sylvia. Those two pay in advance, that's the policy. But I just got here, how was I supposed to know? That's always been the policy. Well, Helen was as big as a Caterpillar tractor. She had muscles and moves like a cat, you know? So we're talking nice and soft, see, and she says would you like to come up to my place? Grunfield's Market was just down the block from Marv's. Best grocery chickens in Cleveland. And we are from the Coventry Friends Association. But not everyone was impressed. You've heard of us, yeah, we're a grassroots organization Brent's father was a famous judge and Brent wanted to follow in his footsteps. Rest of the neighborhood. I think that explains the jacket and the fancy hairstyle. Noticed a bit of a stench. It's the odor-An odor? You're here to complain about an odor? It's nothing personal, really, Mr. Grunfield Listen, you want to clean up some place, go see my cousin Marv five doors down. Good day. Hello, Manny. Benny, could you believe? These people come in and want me to clean up a chicken odor. - A chicken odor? - A chicken odor. They want to complain, they should complain on Marv, not me. He's the one stays open all night and brings all the cooks into the neighborhood. - He has to do business. - Some business. He begs me I should give him my best chickens at cost so he can make his farshtinkener sandwiches. And then you know what he does. He writes me two bad checks, two in a row! Pretty soon I don't have a business. Davis the baker, Sam the fish man, my own customers, they're gone. They all went up to the mall. The cooks keep coming, I'll have to go there too. There are chickens in the mall? Who knows, who knows? Hey, hey, whoa. You guys have to pay in advance if you want anything. What? You skipped out without paying last night. But we put the money right under this ashtray. And with a big old tip too, didn't we? Hey, can you fry these up for us? Alright! No, one a piece. What is it? The Marvel, corn beef, tongue, chicken breast, chopped liver, eggs, onion and kosher chicken shmaltz. Delicious, isn't it? Now I've seen 'em in China. I've seen 'em in India. I've seen 'em in France, even Japan, but never have I seen ones that were freckled. These were phenomenal. So before you can say Grunfield gave me a whole chicken today. Try one. I'm so hungry. You can have this back, Marv, thanks. Hey. Some guy in a dress is stealing my food. A guy in a dress? Excuse me, guys. Listen, Marv, you know I'm president of the Coventry Friends Association now? Well I have to tell you we have been receiving numerous complaints from the community about your operation and we've come up with a few suggestions. One is to limit your hours. - Limit my hours? - Yeah. You must be joking. No I tell you what, the coffee's on me. Oh, you can have another free Marvel. How about that? No, I don't want this, I'm trying to make a point, Marv. Everything's gonna be all right. - I don't want this. - Don't worry about it. Your pain kind of moving away? You're working too hard. Don't get jealous, I'll get to you later. There we are, feel it. You feel any better? Now speaking of someone who has tension in their body. - Turn around, turn around. - What are you doing? Oh relax, it's called a massage. Don't worry, it's fine. Tension, tension, tension. That's not good when you tense up like that. Susan, come on over, I have something for you. For me? Of course for you. Come, sit with us. Bring your books with you. And we get into conversation. So on this one occasion the next thing I know they're inviting me to dinner. Well, I can't turn that down because you know, a lot of those Italians cook. Then I begin to notice every time I'm there how Helen's chair is closer and closer to mine. - How about some coffee? - No thanks. How about a tea biscuit? They're very good. Thanks, I already ate. - I gotta go. - So soon? Yeah, I got a hair appointment. - Hope it comes out well. - Yeah. I painted this a few years ago from a magazine cover but it looks a lot like you. Yeah, I guess maybe, maybe in the eyes a little. You like it? Yeah, it's really great. Here. Thanks. It's always hard part that used to a new job. People are hard to get along with. Don't worry about it. You'll get used to 'em and they'll get used to you. I just don't think that Grace likes me. Marv. I don't think that she dislikes you. It's pretty hard for her to accept anybody, I think. She's worried about her own position. He really eats a lot. Yeah, well, he was in the camps. It's like when you're trying to make up for lost sleep. He's trying to make up for lost food. You just can't do it. What now? What? That waitress you hired has got to go. She doesn't do any work. Gracie, I'm trying to make something very special here and I keep getting interrupted. Maybe I'm the one that should leave. Gracie. Listen to this. I got plans for this place. Listen, I've had this idea, I'm gonna expand this place into a cocktail lounge. I'm going to have cocktail waitresses and we're gonna have them wear these costumes. What kind of costumes? Cocktail waitress costumes, nothing, something that's nice. Something fancy. Who's gonna hire them? Only one person, you. What about Ruth? Well, if this thing works, I'll have enough money to take care of her. I can get a divorce and then we can, Gracie, look at me. And then there'll just be the two of us. Okay. Oh, stay right here. Don't move. Don't move! Hold it up. What's this for? I wanted to wear it when we open the cocktail lounge. Hold it up. Oh my God. You look beautiful. You are so mm. Oh. What am I gonna do with you? I have to work. Alison, I love you! Go to hell, Doug. Hey, we're having a party at Cumberland Meadows tonight. No, it's true, man. Bring all your friends. Tonight at Cumberland Meadows. Man, I need a woman. Damn that house. Got any more wine? No money, no spirits, no food, no reefer. Man, how are we gonna have a party? Marv. He looked at me like I felt like somebody on the cover of a novel. He was so cute. I've seen him with some other girls but I'm not really sure if he has a steady girlfriend. There's only one way to find out. How? - Seduce him. - Seduce him? He doesn't even look at me. That's not surprising. What do you mean? You're like an open book. You're too honest. What's wrong with being honest? Guys don't like it. You've gotta act more mysterious. Like you don't care. Put on an act. I can't do that. Then some other girl will. Try these on. Not bad. Now you have to figure out what else you're going to wear. You didn't refill the ketchup bottles last night. I didn't know what was supposed to. I shouldn't have to tell you everything. Jesus, Gracie, you didn't have to snap at her like that. It's her first week. I suppose you like her or something. Gracie, please don't start. Horowitz called. He's giving us one week to catch up on all the rent or he's serving us with eviction papers. Horowitz is throwing Marv out of the building. Who told you that? I heard Grace talking. That woman is a worry wart. You know what she needs is a little. Morty, shush, we're in mixed company. A man worked hard all his life, then they put him out? That's how it is. You going somewhere special tonight or something? No. Well you're all dolled up. Morty, shush, let her study. Would you stop shushing me? Oh God Trotsky. Should call it history of western imperialism. I can't believe you actually pay to get brainwashed. I'm not paying, I got a scholarship. Smart gal, she got a scholarship. You know why you're studying this stuff? So I can do well on the exam? Why? I don't know. I just, I want to do well. She'll do well. She'll meet a nice man. He'll make good money. - Well, that's not exactly- - Money, money, money. It's all this corrupt society ever thinks about. What's wrong with a little capitalism? Man wants to sell me a tea biscuit, I like them so I buy it. Well it's not that you like them. But I do like them. No, you don't like them. You think you like them because the pigs of capitalism have brainwashed you. Now in a Marxist society You know I was at one of them Communist rallies once, some dame invited me. Boy, did she have a nice rack. I wasn't talking about the Communist party. I'm talking about Marxism. Some Russian gal, she told me she stood in long lines for hours just to buy a banana. They don't have bananas in Russia. Sure they do. They ship them in from Havana. I wasn't talking about bananas! Oops, I gotta go. What can I get for you? How about an iced tea and a bagel. Got to make that 75 cent minimum. Oh hi. Where you going? You, uh, Gracie tells me you're doing a great job. Really? Yeah, you got a way with people. Everybody likes you. Thanks. You know, if you keep this up, maybe, this is no promise but I could make you my head hostess. I don't really. Ooh, come on, baby! I better go. Where you going? I gotta get upstairs. Sure, okay. If you gotta go, you gotta go. Hey baby. I hit the jackpot tonight. You gonna let these roughnecks stay? Of course, they're paying customers. But I don't like the way they're treating the waitress. - They can handle it. - But Marv... I gotta do what's good for business. It's the deadbeats who sit here all night sipping coffee I gotta worry about it. Come back anytime, guys. Hey, Marv-man. What? What do you troublemakers want? We need to talk. Alright, you see, there's gonna be this, well, kind of an orgy tonight at Cumberland Meadows. - Orgy? - Yeah. There's gonna be a lot of girls there. Girls, huh? Well yeah and see the thing is we need to get these girls a little loosened up, you know? So I was hoping, you know, someone would do the catering. Well I'd like to, but I can't leave Gracie here alone to run the place, poor woman. Marianne said she'd be there. Oh and the new waitress, she has a crush on you, man. - Susan? - Yeah, Susan. She's kind of shy, but you know, all work and no play makes Marv a dull boy. Where'd you say this party was supposed to be? What are you doing? Catering a party. What party? Oh, some party, that's all. Oh, you'll need help, I should go with you. Gracie, if you come with me, who's gonna mind the store? It'll fall apart. So where is this party? Gracie, it's, I don't know. You're catering a party, you should know where it's at. I know where it is, It's in Shaker Heights somewhere. You're up to something. I'm up to something, all right. I'm up to working 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That's what I'm up to. I'm up to never having a day off, the one who's responsible for anything that goes wrong. I killed four rats last week. What rats? In the basement? I killed four of them. You didn't tell me about that? Well, how could I tell you? It's too disgusting. I killed them with a broom. Crushed them. Oh my God. I don't want to talk about it. Oh Marv, why didn't you tell me? Oh, it's all right, it's all right. I can't think of it now. I gotta get to the party. I'll wait for you. No, no, no, no, no, you need to go home. You work hard too. No, Marv, I wanna wait for you. Okay. I'll be back just as soon as I can. Alright! Thanks, Marv. So, where's Susan? Hold your horses, man. I thought you said Tommy would be here. I didn't say he would for sure. Well I better get going. Why don't you loosen up for once? Susan? Man, I am beat. I waited for you. We ran out of corned beef and chicken. Probably you took it with you for the catering. I called Grunfield at home. He said he wouldn't sell us any more chicken. Said he'd see you in court. - Gracie- - You weren't here and the customers were complaining so I thought maybe Gracie, don't be mad at me, Gracie. I am so, God, what am I doing? What am I doing in this place? Sometimes I think I'd just like to forget this. Forget everything. You have me, don't forget that. Dirty God damn queers. Stop! Oh shit! Come on! Want some? - Morty. - Hey. Got a headache? No, it's okay, I'm fine. Ever tried heat therapy? What is that? Here, take my hand and point it wherever the pain is the strongest. Go ahead. Pain still there? - Did it move? - A little. Well move my hand. How do you know this stuff? Well, I've had some training. Healers and Sherpas. They keep inviting me to dinner. I'm hungry, so I go. Then one day Helen's brother says to me he wants to have a man to man talk. Uh-oh, I know this spells trouble. 'Cause it has been my experience in this kind of matter. Nice gal, isn't she? Yeah, sure. So what do you do? I'm a healer. Oh, you're a doctor. No, I don't believe in the practices of the medical profession. I'm a natural-path. Sounds like fancy business. - You make good money? - Benny! Getting more and more clients every day. - What's your last name? - Blankenhorner. Hmm, never heard of it. Is that Slavic? No, actually. You're not her grandfather by any chance, are you? No, no, of course not. Sorry, I gotta get back to work. So you want to give me your phone number? Yeah, sure. So then he says, well, don't you like Helen? I say sure I like Helen. And then he says, well, don't you want to marry her? Then before I have a chance to answer, he says, you know being a kike won't bother her. I didn't know what I just said, I was speechless. You listening to me? Where you going, hey? Susan, I'm worried about you. What do you mean? Well, you're a very sweet girl. I don't want to see you get hurt. Benny, what are you talking about? That fella you were talking to. I really can't talk about this right now. But Susan. The Slavic fella, what was his name? - Tommy. - Waitress. Tommy, that's right. You should stay away from him. I can't talk about this right now. I wouldn't trust him. What do you know about him anyway? What's to know? Anybody can see. How about some fucking service? Look, would you just stop following me around? This is really none of your business anyway. Calm down, I don't wanna upset you. It's just that you've been here a while and you're a sweet girl and we worry about you, kind of like your family. Look, I came here to get away from my family. I don't need a whole new set of parents butting into my business. But we weren't butting into your business. We, we just Will you just leave me alone? Marv! Out. Get out of here. - What? - And don't come back. What, man, what? You think I'm stupid? Get out of here. - What? - Out! Out! Hey, you fucking pigs, what are you doing? Leave him alone, he didn't do nothing. Thank you, officers. Come back when you're through and I'll get you some sandwiches. Man, Marv's really in with the pigs. Well, maybe those dudes will finally wake up. Wake up is right, Marv's finally learning some common sense. I don't understand it. I've never seen him so angry before. - Well finally. - Bunch of fascists Oh yeah. Hey man, think I can crash here tonight? - Dee got thrown in jail and - Fuck that, man. Last time you were here, you stole my stash. You ought to be locked up with him. I was just borrowing it, man. Look, I'll bring you more plus double. Now way. Alison, you tell him. Hi. Come on in. You have a really nice place. This is where I treat my clients. But it doubles as a living room. Have a seat. Care for something? Sure. I've never actually tried that before. Never? Well isn't it supposed to be, you know, dangerous? Hey, it's good for you. It's therapeutic. It's just that I smoked something last night. This is the best stuff on the market. I would never give you anything funky. You can trust me. Just inhale real deep and hold it in your lungs. - You okay? - I'm fine. There you go. I don't feel anything. Patience, you will. Excuse me. Hey man. You think I could crash here tonight? I've been through some rough shit. Well. Sorry about that. What's on your mind? Nothing. Come on, sure there is. Well, it's just that I always see you with all these girls. They all seem to be crazy about you. I mean, I know I like you but why did you choose me? Because, you're special, that's why. I'm so hungry. You are? Well, better take care of that. Sweet or salty? - Definitely sweet. - Sweet, huh? Mm, yes. Oh no. Better go find it. What are you doing? I've got to find my grape. What are you staring at? Stop, just ignore him. Hey man, I asked you a question, you got a problem? No, I don't have a problem. Then what are you staring at? I wasn't staring at anything. Look, we don't want any trouble. We just wanna get something to eat, okay? Damn it! You know, it used to be my wife and I would fight like cats and dogs. I'd come here to get away. Now I come here and everyone's fighting like cats and dogs. This fucker doesn't like your beer. Marty, you gotta get rid of these scumbags. Who you calling a scumbag, fuckhole? He really didn't mean it. What do you mean I didn't mean it? Of course I meant it. - Calm down, calm down. - Look at me. - I want an apology. - Get him out of here. You'll take care of it, just like you take care of all the cockroaches, huh? How about a ride on my hog, baby? Look, I'll give you 10% off of all the things that you eat, okay? You and your girl. Look, you're not the only one with friends down at city hall, Marv. What are you doing? I wish I could lie here forever. Yeah, me too. Whoa, what time is it? Shit, I got a client coming soon. You gotta go. Oh, you know the landlord is supposed to be doing something about that. He keeps putting me off if you know what I mean. How about a piece of fresh German chocolate cake? You have a serious roach problem here, Mr. Bel-key. You know Alma, I've been in the deli business since I've been 12 and I've never seen a kitchen that didn't have a few problems. If you don't take care of these things in two weeks, I'll have to close you down. Gracie, dial up city hall and get me Mr. Kilmsy. Tell him Christmas is coming. What? Kilmsy's been retired. Huh? Get out of here! Marv, this is public property. We have a right to peacefully demonstrate. Out! Come on guys, keep singing. I can't believe it. He used to come here every night and I'd have Timbers make him an extra thick pastrami sandwich, and I mean extra thick, like that. You know, I'm the one who fed him through school. And then he turns around and stabs me in the back just because he's a lawyer now. He thinks he can tell me how to run my business. Who does he think he is? What happened? The pastrami steamer blew up. For Christ sakes, I just had it serviced. That was three years ago. Go to Schlo and Moe's and buy 20 pounds. There's no money. What do you mean no money? There's nothing left in petty cash. I looked at the books and we're in debt over $3,000. Don't pay the payroll tax. We haven't paid that in five months. Cancel the insurance. We canceled that last year. Marv, don't do it. Moish? Yeah, it's me. Give me a $200 on Fat Chance, fourth race at Santa Anita. - That's everything. - I feel lucky. That's what I said. $200, Fat Chance, fourth race, Santa Anita. 12 to one, you've lost your mind. I told ya, I feel lucky. Get me a corned beef on rye. I'm awfully sorry, Morty, but we're out of corned beef tonight. Well then get me a pastrami. We're out of that too. What? You going vegetarian or something? We have everything else. Isn't that nice, everything but pastrami and corned beef. Morty, just order. All right, give me a matzoh ball and give him a cheese blintz. Imagine running a deli without pastrami and corned beef. What'll be next, the pickles? It's not her fault the pastrami steamer blew up. Well, last week it was the ceiling. Before that it was the furnace. Frankly, I wouldn't mind if them communists did close Marv down. Where would you go? Schlo and Moe's. They close at eight. Alright then, I'll go what-cha-ma-call-it. - The saloon? - Yeah, the saloon. It burned down, don't you remember? That's just the problem. He knows he's the only place. He can serve dirt if he wanted and people would still come. Them communists, they can march and complain all they want, nothing will close down Marv's. He's got an empire. - Hi Mom. - Dougie. I was wondering if I could stay here for a couple days. - No, I don't think so. - Frank. Think you just ought to get out of here. I mean, just for a couple of days, I'll stay out of the way. Yeah, just like you stay out of the way when you're smoking marijuana, preaching free love, huh? Just like you stayed out of the way when John got his head blown off. Well I think you can just stay out of the way now. Frank. - Dougie. - Mom. Hey, Susan. Hi, look, I'm sorry to come by unannounced but I got locked out of my apartment. Hey, it's all right, come on in. Deville bunched with Fat Chance trailing the pack. Come on, come on, you imbecile. Heading for home, Lady Day looks to be winning. And here comes Fat Chance making the move. Middle of the stretch, Breeze, Lightning and Fat Chance. Fat Chance, Breeze, Lightning, they're neck and neck, stride for stride, they're coming to the What the fuck? Gracie! Of all the God damn things. Hi Benny. Nothing for me, thank you. Is it okay if I sit down? Why, you're soaking wet. There. Aren't you working tonight? It's my day off. What are you working on? It's nice. You think so? I couldn't decide between red and blue but I have some extra red pens I got on sale so I figured why not. Would you like a cup of coffee? Sure. How about a tea biscuit too? Okay, thanks. One way or a two way operation. Grace, where are the batteries? I needed them for the flashlight. Before he was reduced to giving Marv bargains he was a very famous illustrator. Now this here, this was his blue period, right Benny? Her ruby red lips parted invitingly. Kyle swept her into his arms and kissed her passionately. Her entire body pulsated, Benny, I can't believe you actually subscribe to this decadent trash. I didn't write it, I just did the illustrations. Man, the only reason they print this trash is to distract the masses from their real. Oh wow. Money, money, all this corrupt society ever thinks about. Look, every war, Vietnam Come on, keep reading. Hey guys, what's going on? Doug, hey man, where you been? How's Dee? - Pigs put them in jail, man. - Good. But they don't have anything on him. It turns out the pervert janitor just had a concussion. I keep telling you, man, pigs up their orders, keep the people down. You gonna eat that? Hey Timbers. Hey Timbers. I'm not supposed to serve you. Come on, man. Thanks. Where did you get these, huh? I had 'em with me. I'm tired of your games. Come on, come on, that was a long time ago. Just let me stay. Would you steal from your own home? I don't have a home, this is my home. Are you gonna do this again? - You won! - I won? - We won the race! - I won the race! - Does that mean I can stay? - I guess so, man. Alright! So Marv's luck was good for once and for a while everybody was happy. It was almost like being in a Broadway musical. But musicals don't last forever. It started when the protestors marched in. The roughnecks couldn't resist a fight. People began taking advantage of the situation. Brothers and sisters, the time has come, the time is ours! We will smash the capitalist god above! We will never be brought down! We will not be I think the whole thing drove Marv over the edge. Within a week, Marv's was gone. It was the last straw for the landlord. He evicted Marvin. Pretty soon the entire block was up for sale. Marv and Grace wound up in Florida, walking distance from the racetrack. And Susan found a library job and a room a lot closer to campus. As for Coventry, well, it was different. Marv's wasn't perfect and never easy. It was noisy, people fought there, people got in each other's business, but it had its good points. That's for sure. So we were married one week when Helen says to me there's something I need to tell you. I say what, tell me. She says, will you still love me? I say, yeah, yeah, go ahead. You know what she says? Look what I got. What's that? Four bags at the Daffy Dollar store for 98 cents. 11 ribbons each bag. What do you use those for? Oh, lots of things. You got the adhesive on the back. You can stick it to anything. - Like what? - Oh, this and that. Presents maybe. When was the last time you gave me a present? I didn't say for you. Hey guys, I'd like to go home too. Go home. Half-hour till the bus come. 7A, take the 7A. In about 30 minutes Marshall Dillon's kicking us out, Jesus.\n"

      "WÜSTE IN NORDAFRIKA 8.000 v. Chr. GISE, ÄGYPTEN Professor! Catherine! Nicht so schnell! - Wir haben etwas Wunderschönes gefunden! Es ist unglaublich. Sie werden sich wundern! - Ich kann es kaum erwarten! Hier! Hier! Dr. Langford. - Hallo. Was haben Sie gefunden? Abdeckplatten. Das ist ja herrlich! Komm, Catherine! Was in Gottes Namen ist das? - Wenn ich das wüsste... Seht nur! Darunter ist etwas begraben! Sieht aus wie ein Fossil. H EUTE ...Überall findet man Symbole. Namen, die Titel der Besitzer, Listen der Opfergaben. Jedes grössere Gebäude jener Zeit war mit Hieroglyphen übersät. Wann wird die wissenschaftliche Gemeinde akzeptieren, dass die Pharaonen der 4. Dynastie nicht die grosse Pyramide erbaut haben? In der Pyramide, einem der eindrucks- vollsten Bauwerke aller Zeiten, gibt es überhaupt keine Schrift- zeichen! - Dr. Jackson, Sie vergessen, dass Colonel Vyse Inschriften von Steinbrucharbeitern entdeckt hat, die Khufus Namen bezeichnen, und zwar in der Pyramide! Das war eine Fälschung. Das können Sie hoffentlich beweisen! Wer hat dann Ihrer Meinung nach die Pyramiden erbaut? Ich weiss es nicht... Die Bewohner von Atlantis? Oder vielleicht Marsmenschen? Es geht nicht darum, von wem, sondern wann sie erbaut wurden. Wir wissen alle, dass neueste geologische Ergebnisse die Sphinx viel früher datieren. Deshalb müssen wir anfangen, unsere bisherigen Erkenntnisse neu zu überdenken. Ich habe nachgewiesen, dass ein vollständig entwickeltes Schriftsystem bereits in den ersten beiden Dynastien existierte... ...das auf einer noch früheren Vorlage zu basieren scheint. Ist jetzt Mittagspause, oder warum gehen alle... Dr. Jackson! - Ja? Jemand möchte Sie sprechen. Die Air Force? Was soll das? - Würden Sie bitte zum Auto kommen? Fahren wir irgendwohin? - Keine Angst. Die nehmen wir. Sind das Ihre Eltern? Pflegeeltern. Worum geht es hier eigentlich? Um eine Arbeit. Was für eine Arbeit? Übersetzung. Von alten ägyptischen Hieroglyphen. Interessiert? Ich gehe jetzt. Wohin? Sie sind gerade aus Ihrer Wohnung geflogen. Sie haben kein Geld mehr. Alles, was Sie besitzen, ist in den beiden Taschen. Würden Sie nicht gerne beweisen, dass Sie Recht haben? Jetzt haben Sie die Gelegenheit. Was ist das? Reisepläne. Mrs. O'Neil? Kommen Sie rein. Mrs. O'Neil, ist Ihr Mann zu Hause? Ja. Könnten wir ihn sprechen? Sie können es ja mal versuchen. Entschuldigen Sie, Colonel O'Neil. Wir kommen von General Wests Büro. Wir kommen, um Ihnen zu sagen, dass Sie reaktiviert wurden. Der ist ja völlig fertig. Was ist los mit ihm? - Sein Sohn hat sich aus Versehen erschossen. - Gott! M I LITÄRISCH E El N RICHTU NG Freigegeben. Erkältung? Allergien. Immer, wenn ich irgendwohin fahre. So, bitte. Dr. Jackson, ich bin Dr. Gary Meyers, guten Tag. - Hallo. Wo sind wir? - Unterirdische Atomwaffenbasis. Aber keine Angst, sie wurde völlig umfunktioniert. Ich bin Barbara Shore. Jackson, willkommen unter der Erde. - Hallo. Wo haben Sie das gefunden? - Auf dem Gise-Plateau. 1928. So was habe ich noch nie gesehen. - Natürlich nicht. Das hat niemand. - Es gibt 2 Reihen mit Hieroglyphen. Die innere enthält die klassischen Zeichen, aber die äussere ähnelt den Zeichen in der Mitte. Diese Schrift kennen wir nicht. - Das sind keine Hieroglyphen. Es sieht eher aus wie Hieratisch oder Keilschrift. Die Übersetzung der inneren Reihe ist falsch. Der Übersetzer hatte die falsche Literatur. Was machen Sie da? Wir haben uns aller bekannten Techniken bedient. Komisches Wort, oder? \"Gebeh\"? Ja. - Dann ein Adverbial, \"sedjem-en-ef\". \"Versiegelt und begraben.\" Entschuldigung, was soll das? Das heisst nicht \"Sarg\". \"Für alle Zeiten...\" Wer hat das bloss übersetzt? Ich... Das heisst: \"Seit 1 Million Jahren unser Sonnengott Re, versiegelt und begraben für alle Zeiten.\" Nicht \"Himmelspforte\"... sondern... \"Sternentor\". Warum ist das Militär an 5.000 Jahre alten Tafeln interessiert? In meinem Bericht heisst es: 10.000 Jahre. Guten Tag, Colonel. Kenne ich Sie? - Colonel Jack O'Neil aus General Wests Büro. Ich übernehme ab hier. 10.000 Jahre... Da gab es die ägyptische Kultur noch gar nicht. Die Schall- und Radiokarbontests waren eindeutig. - Lag ein Grab darunter? Nein, aber was wir gefunden haben, ist viel interessanter. - Entschuldigung, aber diese Information wurde für geheim erklärt. Ab jetzt werden ohne meine ausdrückliche Erlaubnis keine Informationen an Zivilisten weitergegeben. Was soll das? - Ich weiss auch nicht. Colonel O'Neil! Sie schulden mir eine Erklärung. Man sagte mir, ich hätte freie Hand. Pläne ändern sich. Warum sind Sie hier? Warum hat man Sie mit diesem Projekt beauftragt? Ich bin hier für den Fall, dass Sie erfolgreich sind. 2 WOCH EN SPÄTER Keine Übereinstimmung mit Keilschrift und anderen Hieroglyphen gefunden. Die Symbole auf der Steinplatte habe ich verglichen mit allen bekannten Schriftmustern aus der Zeit. Aber ich habe keine Ähnlichkeiten gefunden. Dafür werde ich niemals Geld sehen. Kann ich das ausleihen? Orion. Hierher, Daniel. - Jackson, das ist General West. - Oh, hallo. Sie haben also in 14 Tagen gelöst, was sie in zwei Jahren nicht geschafft haben. Wir wären so weit. Ich habe hier etwas vorbereitet. Würden Sie das bitte weitergeben? Leider habe ich nicht für jeden ein Exemplar. Egal. Sie sehen hier die Abdeckplatten. Die Symbole der äusseren Reihe, die Sie versucht haben zu übersetzen, sind in Wirklichkeit Sternenkonstellationen. Ihre Anordnung folgt einem bestimmten Muster, wie auf einer Karte. Hier sind sieben Punkte, was eine Art Kursbestimmung sein könnte. Um ein bestimmtes Ziel zu erreichen, innerhalb eines dreidimensionalen Raumes, brauchen wir sechs Punkte, um den genauen Standort zu bestimmen. Gerade haben Sie gesagt, 7 Punkte. Sechs Punkte, um den Standort festzulegen, aber um den Kurs zu bestimmen, braucht man einen Ausgangspunkt. Aber auf der Kartusche sind nur 6 Symbole. Das 7. Symbol ist nicht auf der Kartusche, sondern hier unten, gekennzeichnet... durch eine kleine Pyramide... zwei... lustige... putzige kleine Männchen und einen komischen Strich, der oben rauskommt. Naja, egal... Er hat es. Nein! Dieses Symbol ist nicht auf dem Gerät. Welches Gerät? Zeigen Sie es ihm. Was ist das? Das ist Ihr Sternentor. Kommen Sie, Jackson. Monitore hochfahren! - Sind hochgefahren! Mitch, zeigen Sie die Details auf dem Hauptmonitor! Hier sind die Details. Halten Sie an! Warten Sie! Haben Sie einen... Ja, genau... Entschuldigung! Hey, lassen Sie das! - Zwei Figuren auf jeder Seite, die neben einer Pyramide beten, während die Sonne über ihnen steht. Stimmt. Wir hatten es die ganze Zeit vor Augen. General West, Jackson hat das siebte Symbol identifiziert. Beginnen Sie. - Programmiere siebtes Symbol in den Computer. 1. Symbol wird geladen. 1. Symbol in Position. Leistung liegt bei 23 Prozent. 2. Symbol wird geladen. Aktiviert. - 2. Symbol in Position. - Wir sind bei 35 Prozent. Das Tor kommt in die kritische Phase. Das gesamte Personal evakuieren. Bereich geräumt. Wir gehen raus. Tür verriegeln. War das unter den Deckplatten? - Ja. Mein Vater hat es 1928 gefunden. Es besteht aus einem Mineral, das auf der Erde nicht existiert. 5. Symbol in Position. 79 Prozent. 6. Symbol wird geladen. 6. Symbol in Position. Weiter sind wir bisher nie gekommen. Es bricht zusammen. Schalte auf Handbetrieb. 7. Symbol in Position. Schicken Sie eine Sonde hinein. Los, los! Ja, Sir? Zeichnen Sie sämtliche Daten auf. Innenraum freimachen! - Alle Mann raus hier! - Los geht's! Die Sonde hat sich selbständig gemacht. Das gibt's nicht! Der Strahl hat einen Punkt erreicht... irgendwo in der Kaliam-Galaxis. Er ist gewaltig, vielleicht ein Mond oder ein grosser Asteroid. Wo sind wir? Der blaue Punkt. Richtig, Jackson. Auf der anderen Seite des uns bekannten Universums. Wir verlieren das Signal. Diese Aufnahmen wurden von der Sonde übermittelt. Anhalten und vergrössern. Man kann das Tor auf der anderen Seite sehen. Diese Tore dienen als Durchgang zwischen unseren Welten. Die Zusammensetzung der Atmosphäre ist ähnlich wie bei uns. Luftdruck, Temperatur... Und vor allem Sauerstoff. Lebenserhaltung: Akzeptabel. Diese Zeichen sind anders. Anders als auf unserem Tor. - Deshalb sollten wir es abbrechen. Ohne einen Erkundungstrupp ist dieses Projekt sinnlos. Wenn wir dort sind, müssten wir die Zeichen auf ihrem Tor entziffern und könnten auf diese Weise wieder zurückkehren. Unter den gegebenen Umständen scheint mir das unmöglich. Ich könnte das tun. Meinen Sie? Auf jeden Fall. Der hat doch 'nen Vogel. Sie sind dabei. Ich hoffe, Ihnen ist klar, dass das die Sache erschwert. Deshalb wollte ich Sie dabeihaben. Wir haben das Tor zu einer Welt geöffnet, über die wir nichts wissen. Ich habe etwas für Sie. Nein, ich... - Doch! Ich habe es am Sternentor gefunden, als ich ein Kind war. Es hat mir Glück gebracht. Bringen Sie es mir zurück. Sicherungsspeicher. Reservestrom: Eingeschaltet. Alles klar. Gehen wir. - Los, raus hier! Überwachung und Senderempfang. ...Ausrüstung und Reservestrom... Wenn jemand was zu sagen hat, dann soll er es jetzt tun. Vektorverfolgung aktiviert. Molekulare Auflösung in vollem Gange! Jackson, alles klar, es ist vorbei! Bleiben Sie bei ihm! Sie müssen sich bewegen. Es hört gleich wieder auf. Was für ein Höllentrip! Wir müssen hier weg! Es ist alles da. Wir bilden drei Teams, und dann los! Team 2, los! Hier ist nichts. Luftverhältnisse stabil. - Draussen ist es genauso wie innen! Ich seh mich mal um. Kawalsky. Feretti. Weiter! Gut. Ich hab's gewusst. Eins - drei - drei - zwei. Bericht! Der Scan für den Umkreis von 400 m ist fast abgeschlossen. Packt das ein und geht wieder rein! In einer Stunde sollen alle wieder am Stargate sein. Sie kommen doch mit, oder, Colonel? Jackson, fangen Sie jetzt mit dem Stargate an. Was soll das? - Keine Ahnung, Feretti. Ich brauche mehr Zeit. Hier gibt es bestimmt noch mehr Bau- werke und Anzeichen von Zivilisation. Ein andermal. Gehen Sie rein und nehmen Sie Kontakt auf. So leicht geht das nicht. Das ist eine Kopie der Pyramide von Gise. Wir werden hier keine Hieroglyphen oder sonstige Inschriften finden. Wir müssen uns ein wenig umsehen... Sie sind hier, um das Stargate zu aktivieren. Sind Sie dazu in der Lage? Nein. Können Sie nicht, oder wollen Sie nicht? Ich kann die Zeichen zwar entziffern, aber ich brauche auch die Koordinaten. Auf der Erde befanden sie sich auf Steinplatten. Und so was müssen wir hier auch finden. Was heisst hier \"finden\"? Davon war nicht die Rede. - Ich nahm an, dass sie hier in der Nähe sind. Sie nahmen an! Sie verdammter Lügner! Von \"finden\" war nie die Rede! Bauen Sie ein Lager auf und checken Sie die Vorräte. Das ist ein Befehl. Ist das heiss! Wir hängen hier fest! - Hör auf zu meckern, Feretti! Ja, hör endlich auf. - Ja, bitte. Wenn wir nicht zurückkommen, aktivieren sie das Tor von drüben. Das funktioniert aber nicht. Wenn wir es nicht von hier aus schaffen, ist es aus mit uns. Also Jungs, das heisst, wir gehen nirgendwohin. Schönes Zelt. Oh, jeder bekommt ein Zelt. Schön. Was ist das alles? Ich brauch keine Thermodecke... Alles da ausser Sonnenschutzcreme. Haben Sie nicht eigentlich was zu tun? Z. B. Uns hier rauszubringen? Fusspuder, toll! Gut gemacht! Das Basislager steht. Wo ist Jackson? Ruhig, ganz ruhig! Braves Tier! Was willst du? Willst du was hiervon? Das würde ich nicht tun! Es hat ein Geschirr. Es ist zahm. Mach dich los! Tut doch was! Schneller! Helft mir doch! Alles klar, Jackson? Kawalsky. - Die haben Sie verloren. - Brown. Hau bloss ab! Immer langsam. Na dann, Jackson. Jetzt sind Sie dran. Wieso ich? Sie sind Linguist. Sprechen Sie mit Ihnen. Was haben Sie gesagt? - Gar nichts. Keine Angst! Alles klar! Siehst du? Grundsubstanz: Quarz. Ich weiss auch nicht... Es klingt vertraut, wie die Berber-Sprache. Vielleicht auch Tschadisch. Danke. Was heisst das? Keine Ahnung. Wir sollen mitkommen. Woher wissen Sie das? Weil er uns auffordert, mit ihm zu gehen. Wir haben nach Anzeichen von Zivilisation gesucht: Bitte sehr! Wir wollen schliesslich nach Hause, oder? - Er hat Recht. Ich habe den Stoff untersucht, den sie abbauen: Dasselbe Material, aus dem das Stargate gemacht wurde. Benachrichtige das Basislager. Sie sollen das Gelände bewachen, bis wir wiederkommen. - Ja, Sir. Basislager, bitte kommen! - Feretti, sie sind es! Komm her! Könnten Sie das noch mal wiederholen? Es sieht so aus, als würden wir noch eine Weile hier bleiben. Alles klar, Sir. - Verstanden? - Ja, Sir. Also, was ist los? - Wir bleiben erst mal hier. So eine Scheisse! Das Auge des Re. Der ägyptische Sonnengott. Sie glauben, er hat uns zu ihnen gesandt. Wie sie wohl darauf kommen... Re! Wo wollen die hin? Ich höre. Feretti! Sir, ich kann ihn nicht verstehen. Noch mal, Feretti. Wir müssen das Basislager abbrechen! Ich wiederhole: Basislager abbrechen! Vergiss es! Du kommst nicht durch! Weg hier, Freeman! Alle wieder rein! Ich nehm die Munition! Schnapp du dir die Batterie! Wir gehen sofort zurück! Was ist? Sie bleiben hier! Was sehen Sie? - Ein Sandsturm kommt direkt auf uns zu. Ausgezeichneter Grund, um alle zu erschiessen. Wir bleiben, bis er vorbei ist. Es tut mir Leid. Wir müssen zurück zur Pyramide! Wo zum Teufel kam das denn her? Kawalsky, Brown, könnt ihr mich hören? Sie sollten nichts essen. Vielleicht sehen sie das als Beleidigung an. Und beleidigen wollen wir sie ja nicht, was, Daniel? Schmeckt wie Hühnchen. Lecker! Schmeckt wie... Wie Hühnchen! Lecker! Sie sagen, das ist ein ägyptisches Symbol. - Ja, das Auge des Re. Meinen Sie nicht, dass... wenn sie ein ägyptisches Symbol kennen... Stimmt. Was ist jetzt wieder? Schreiben scheint ihnen nicht erlaubt zu sein. Was? Sie wollen, dass ich mitkomme. Soll ich? Ich geh mal mit. Wird schon nichts passieren! Ja, das ist schön. Wo kommt dieser Geruch her? Ach da. Ich glaube, das reicht. Meine Hände sind jetzt sauber. Vielen Dank. Danke, nett von euch. Jetzt rieche ich viel besser. O Gott, ich stinke wie ein Büffel! Nein, danke! Ich bin wunschlos glücklich. Jetzt bin ich sauber... Ich dachte, du bist eine von den Waschfrauen... Nein, nein, nein. Das brauchst du nicht. Bitte! Geh jetzt lieber. Ja? Alles in Ordnung. Aber geh jetzt besser. Keine Sorge, alles in Ordnung. Warte, ich helfe dir. Nein, es liegt an mir... Vielen Dank, ich bin sehr zufrieden. Daniel. Ich bin Daniel. Wir sind... Die Pyramide. Siehst du, wir sind... Wir sind von der Pyramide gekommen. Schon gut. Macht nichts. Schon gut. Die Erde. Kennst du das Symbol? Du kennst das Symbol. Hast du das Symbol schon mal gesehen? Zeig es mir. Zeig es mir. Kawalsky, Basislager hier. Kannst du mich hören? Du verschwendest nur die Batterie. Du kommst nicht durch den Sturm. Warte, bis er vorbei ist. - Ja, ja. Falls er jemals aufhört. Ich war im Nahen Osten, aber so was hab ich noch nie gesehen. Ja, ja... - Ich versteh das nicht. Warum aktivieren wir das Tor nicht selbst? So schwer kann das doch nicht sein. - Klar, super! Wenn wir uns mit der Richtung vertun, könnten wir im Weltraum landen. Habt ihr eine Ahnung, wie viele verschiedene Möglichkeiten es da gibt? Wie viele? Halt die Luft an, klar? Was ist hier los? Ausschwärmen! Keine Angst, ist nur ein Feuerzeug. Siehst du? Hier! Ja, ist 'ne tolle Sache. Hast Recht, eine dumme Angewohnheit. Nein, du kannst es behalten. Es gehört dir. Nein! Das ist gefährlich! Was ist das hier bloss? Das gibt's doch nicht. Was? Überhaupt kein Empfang? - Nichts. Immer noch Störungen? Nein. Sie sind komplett verschwunden. Ich konnte Jackson nicht finden. Ich suche Jackson. Dem diese Jacke gehört. Er hat lange Haare, die so ins Gesicht fallen... Nein, nein! Er trägt eine Brille, damit er besser sieht. Ich nehme an, ihr wisst nicht, was ein Weichei ist, oder? Was soll's? Ich hab keine Ahnung, wo ich bin, und suche nach einem Weichei mit langen Haaren, die so ins Gesicht fallen, er trägt eine Brille und niest immer. Hühnchen, Hühnchen! Der Hühnchen-Mann, genau! Du willst die Jacke? Ich dachte, Sie könnten ihre Sprache nicht. Haben Sie mich erschreckt! Ein alter ägyptischer Dialekt, der sich weiterentwickelt hat. Kennt man erst die Vokale... Beantworten Sie meine Frage. Ich wusste ja nicht, wie man es ausspricht. Auf der Erde spricht man es seit 1000 Jahren nicht mehr. Hier steht: Ein Reisender von einem fernen Stern verliess seine sterbende Welt, um sein Leben zu verlängern. Sein Körper war schwach und krank, sein Tod war unabwendbar. Anscheinend war seine ganze Art vom Aussterben bedroht. Also reiste er... durchsuchte er die Galaxien nach einer Möglichkeit, den Tod zu besiegen. Sehen Sie: Er kam zu einer Welt, die voller Leben war und wo er ein primitives Volk vorfand, Menschen! Ein Volk, das dank seiner Macht und seines Wissens ewig leben könnte. Er erkannte, dass er in einem mensch- lichen Körper weiterleben könnte. Er fand einen Jungen. Es wurde taghell, und während die ängstlichen Dorfbewohner flohen, näherte sich der Junge neugierig und furchtlos dem Licht. Re bemächtigte sich seines Körpers, wie ein Parasit, der einen Wirt sucht. Und in dieser menschlichen Gestalt ernannte er sich selbst zum Herrscher. Mithilfe des Sternentors hat er Tausende hierher gebracht, damit sie in den Minen arbeiten. Wie die, die wir gesehen haben. Dieses Mineral scheint seine gesamte Technologie zu ermöglichen, und das ewige Leben. Aber auf der Erde... gab es eine Rebellion, und das Sternentor wurde begraben. Um hier so etwas zu verhindern, verbot er den Menschen Lesen und Schreiben. Sie sollten die Wahrheit nicht erfahren. Jackson, sehen Sie sich das mal an. Das ist es. Das habe ich gesucht. Sie hofften, das Tor auf der Erde würde eines Tages wieder geöffnet. Ich wusste, dass sie es irgendwo aufgeschrieben haben. Augenblick mal! Wo ist das 7. Symbol? Sicher abgebrochen. Es muss hier irgendwo sein... Hier... ich habe es. Es ist nicht mehr zu erkennen. Ohne das Symbol schaffe ich es nicht. Das war's dann wohl! Kawalsky, Brown! Kommen Sie, Jackson! Was zum Teufel ist das? Hier! Für alle Fälle. Achtung! Wo wollen Sie hin? Was wollen wir am Sternentor? Ich kann es sowieso nicht aktivieren. Schiessen Sie auf alles, was hier rein- kommt. - Und Sie? - Tun Sie's einfach! Was ist das? Wonach suchen Sie? - Es ist weg. Legen Sie sie hin, Jackson. Ihr seid also gekommen, um mich zu vernichten. Was ist das? Das ist eine Bombe. Die haben Sie vorhin gesucht. Was haben Sie sich dabei gedacht? Wozu sind Sie hier? Halt! Nicht! Halt! Nein! Nein! Colonel, ich bin's! Alles in Ordnung? Wo ist Jackson? Sha'uri, was ist passiert? Re hat uns bestraft. Aber warum? Was ist mit Daniel? Was ist mit Daniel? Wir hätten den Fremden nicht helfen dürfen, mein Sohn. Ich war tot? Deshalb habe ich euer Volk ausgewählt: Weil eure Körper so leicht zu reparieren sind. Ihr habt Fortschritte gemacht, habt euch die Atomkraft zunutze gemacht. Was wirst du jetzt tun? Ihr hättet das Tor nicht wieder öffnen sollen. Bald werde ich eure Waffe zu eurer Welt zurückschicken, zusammen mit einer Ladung unseres Minerals, das die Wirkung der Bombe um ein Hundertfaches verstärken wird. Warum willst du das tun? Ich habe eure Zivilisation begründet, und jetzt werde ich sie wieder zerstören. Aber damit meine Arbeiter meine Autorität nicht in Frage stellen, wirst du ihnen beweisen, dass ich ihr Gott bin, indem du deine Kameraden tötest. Und wenn ich mich weigere? Dann werde ich dich vernichten, und alle, die dich gesehen haben. Es kann nur einen Re geben! Re hat eine Versammlung einberufen. Eine Hinrichtung. Skaara! Nabeh! Hört mir zu. Wir dürfen das nicht zulassen. Ihr sollt wissen, was Daniel mir gesagt hat, und zwar, wo unser Volk ursprünglich herkommt, und warum wir nicht länger als Sklaven leben können. Freeman! Jackson! Hier entlang! Los! Kawalsky! Jackson! Auf unseren Sieg! Wir haben eure Waffen! Hier, Colonel. Also was halten Sie davon? Sie sind nicht gerade eine Elitetruppe, aber sie sind bereit zu kämpfen. Nehmen Sie ihnen die Waffen weg, bevor sie sich verletzen! Ihr habt mich gehört. Schickt sie nach Hause. - Sie haben kein Zuhause mehr. Ausserdem brauchen wir ihre Hilfe. - Wofür? Wofür? Warum sagen Sie es ihnen nicht? Erzählen Sie ihnen von der Bombe. Was meint er? Ich hatte einen einfachen Befehl: Beim geringsten Anzeichen von Gefahr sollte ich das Stargate sprengen. Und die Gefahr war da. Aber jetzt hat er Ihre Bombe, und morgen wird er sie zur Erde schicken, zusammen mit dem Mineral, das sie hier abbauen. Und diese Explosion wird hundert Mal stärker sein als die Bombe allein. Ich fange sie ab, bevor er sie losschickt. Warum wusste ich nichts davon? - Dafür gab es keinen Grund. Ich hätte euch vorher alle zurückgeschickt. Ich wäre geblieben und hätte das Tor gesprengt, und das tue ich noch. Es wäre viel wichtiger, das Tor auf der Erde zu vernichten. Stimmt genau, aber da Sie uns nicht zurückbringen können, fällt diese Möglichkeit flach. Wo sind sie? Antwortet! Wir haben überall gesucht. Ein paar von den Jüngeren helfen ihnen. Sie haben es einfach hingenommen, dass Sie auf jeden Fall hier bleiben? Gibt es niemanden, der Sie vermisst? Haben Sie keine Familie? Hatte ich mal. Es sollte einem erspart bleiben, sein Kind zu überleben. Ich will nicht sterben. Genauso wenig wie Ihre Männer und die Leute hier. Sie sind der Einzige, der es eilig damit hat. Wie konntet ihr sie entkommen lassen? Ich dulde keine Versager. Warum lacht ihr? - Das ist keine Arbeit für Ehemänner. Ehemänner? Verheiratet? Sei mir nicht böse. Ich habe es ihnen nicht gesagt. Was denn? Dass du mich nicht wolltest. Was malst du da? Den Tag unseres Sieges. Wenn man die Monde verbindet... Das ist das Symbol für diesen Planeten. Genau! Der Ausgangspunkt. Was machen Sie da? Ich hab's! Was? Das 7. Zeichen! Wir können nach Hause! Gehen wir! Du wirst uns ins Verderben stürzen, mein Sohn! Wir werden nicht länger Sklaven sein, Vater! Kasuf! Sieh dir eure Götter einmal an! Sieh sie dir an! Die Karawane kommt näher. Lass die Bombe zum Sternentor bringen. Was ist da los? Wie geht's denn so? Verdammt! Los, Feretti! Los! Durch die Tür! Alles klar? Verteilen! Los! Wir sind tot! - Halt den Mund! - Was sollen wir machen? - Gib mir Deckung! Wie bitte? Kawalsky! Feretti, hilf mir mal mit dem Ding hier! Lass die Bombe jetzt zur Erde schicken! Ich werde sie persönlich losschicken. Was tun Sie da? - Meinen Auftrag erfüllen. Wir wollten doch das Tor auf der anderen Seite abbauen! - Ja. Das ist Ihr Job. Ich bleibe hier und pass auf, dass sie losgeht. Sie haben 7 Minuten. Daniel! Was haben Sie vor? Jackson! - Warten Sie auf mich. Nabeh! Haben wir noch Munition, Feretti? - Alles weg! - Achtung! Kopf runter! Kawalsky, wir müssen was tun! Verdammt! Hört auf! Du langweilst mich! Ihr werdet gemeinsam sterben! Bestell Tutanchamun schöne Grüsse von mir, Arschloch! Wie viel Zeit haben wir noch? - 45 Sekunden. Er entkommt. Stellen Sie sie ab! - Das kann ich nicht. - Was? Sie wurde manipuliert. Ich habe eine Idee! Hab die ganze Zeit gewusst, dass du uns zurückbringst. - Klar. - Bis dann. Danke, Daniel. Wollen Sie das wirklich machen? Ja. Und Sie kommen klar? Auf jeden Fall. Und Sie? Ja. Ja, ich glaube schon. Sagen Sie Catherine, es hat mir Glück gebracht. Mach ich. Wir sehen uns. Dr. Jackson.\n"

      "Carlos! Keep it close to the car, there's a hole. - Easy, easy. - Don't scratch it. - Who's leaving now? - The people from 301. Why? Carlos! Carlos! Come in. So you are here. I've been shouting like a lunatic. I've got a car full of crap and you make like you don't hear me. Hey. Weren't you going to change the lock? Sorry. The kitchen is through there. - Where should I put this? - Over there. Hey. - What a huge muscle. - At your service ma'am. - What are you looking at? - Your ass. My ass? And this miracle? I have an idea. Honey. Just wait until the men leave. I lose the idea. I don't have time for that right now. All right, \"Homo Sapiens\". Just don't forget that once you were a \"Homo Erectus\". Better, isn't it? Healthier. More light. Did you call your mom? Listen to this. This might work as the prologue. Prologue? You've been working on that for three months! Listen, listen. \"The more a man admires a woman because of her success, the harder it is for him to desire her. The new woman is a source of male impotence a castrator, and a cause of divorce\". Papers, papers, letters, letters, bullshit! Hey, don't you think it's rather windy in here? So what's so funny? Nothing, castrator. Impotent. Lady, we're leaving now. Sorry. I didn't introduce you. This is my... Well, he's always here. I'm his muse. And he is my muscle. What a racket! People are so uncivilized. I'm coming! I left the car double-parked. I'm going to move it. - Let's go, my muscle-men. - Excuse us, sir. Leave the door open. I don't want to have to battle with it. No, Sandy. Please, try to understand. Tell Roy the commercial will be photographed by Naoto Tekata. I know he is expensive, but you're not paying, so don't interfere. Also tell him that the slogan is \"Comet sausages, the best on the planet\". Yeah, I know it's awful, but what do you want me to do, damn it? Look, tell that to the client. He liked it. They're hicks. See you. You look horrible. It's six o'clock, we are late. This is the last time you come to my office fucking dressed like that. Andrea, where are you going? If you don't like how I look, I'm not going. Taxi! Andrea, get in the car. - Let go of me! - Get back in the car! - Get back in the car! - Let me go! - Get back in the car! - Let go of me! Honey. We're making a scene. So, what's new? Taxi! Let's go home so you can put on something decent. What's indecent about this? It's French. But we're going to the house of the agency's president! Yes, and since you've just been appointed international accounts director, you can't go with a shabby woman. Maybe, someone will remember you when you were communist. Hey, mister! Let me go! Let's go home. Let's go. I've had enough. There, you see? This is what I get for being so democratic at home. Go on. Get out of the way man. - Get out of there. - I don't want to. - Get out of the car! - I don't want to! - Get out, damn it! - I don't want to! Get out, I said! Watch out, asshole! Marisa. You must have brought something. A kimono. Marisa, I just came back from Kenya. The Zulus don't wear kimonos. Well, maybe you brought a mask, some feathers, a bone. - Something. - I'm dead tired! You erased it! Do you like them? They're for Tomás. I also bought some hats, balloons. Plug it back in. But it's been seven years since I saw him. - Please. - Yeah, yeah. I know. I'm like a gonorrhea, I burn, I itch, but come on, look what I bought for Tomás. Ana! Let me work. Either you throw that essay into the trash - or I jump out the window. - You can jump! What's the matter with you? What are you afraid of? You. Me? Why? Because I know you, darling. Hey, but I... Ana, I love you. I love you too. Isn't that enough? Nothing in life satisfies us completely. Nothing is enough. It only lasts a moment and then it's gone. Like this kiss. He's here! I don't want to go to dinner at Miguel and Andrea's on Friday. Why don't you make up an excuse? Or do you want to go play referee? You do it. I don't want to. No, no. Good evening. Good evening. Don't you think we are making fools of ourselves? - No. - Yes, darling. Sorry, I think I've got the wrong apartment. Tomás! I can't believe it. I missed you so much! You monster! Blondie! - Carlitos. - How are you? Are you going bald? Hey, tell me, when did you dye your hair? - What's London like? - Nice. - What do you mean nice? - Nice. Just like your apartment. Clown. Singapore was the best. - You were in Singapore? - Not only was I in Singapore, I got married there! - What? - And? Nothing. They closed it. It was a fabulous whorehouse. It didn't bother me much though because I became a Buddhist. - You are a Buddhist now? - No. Now I'm very tired and very thirsty. Where's the kitchen? I'm also happy to be with my two only friends. The surprise. Come here. Ready? One, two... Surprise! WELCOME! Where did you sleep last Tuesday? Where did you sleep! Andrea, it took you three hours to choose a dress. You changed your hairstyle five times. I've been smelling your fucking perfume the whole way. So don't piss me off with the same question. - Where did you sleep? - I didn't sleep! I spent all night working so you can have your gym, the beauty parlor, ashram and master card. You're the one who spoilt me. So now it's my fault that you're idle? If only you had a child! So it was formal dress? Watch what you drink. Do my drinking habits bother you? Miguel! Miguel! Mister Singer. I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you. What do you think? Andrea, Mister Singer, the agency's vice-president. - My wife. - Pleased to meet you. Why aren't you wearing a costume? What's this then? You think I dress like this every day? Excuse me. They're carrying me off. - Is that all now? - No. There's still my tamagochi, my Indian head and my box of condoms. Come on in. Be careful with the door. I thought you didn't bring anything. What would you like to drink? We have to celebrate the arrival of the repentant nomad. Well, nomad, plumber, mime, waiter, translator, limo driver, stripper, diving instructor, balero instructor, art dealer, drug dealer... - And hustler. - What? Okay, okay, okay. Gigolo. You developed professionally these past seven years. No, no, don't get me wrong, Carlitos. Mine was purely a pleasure trip. I'm getting dizzy. Easy, Carlitos, easy. Don't worry. Here, on the floor. Come down to the floor. That's right. Very good. Perfect. Breathe. No, no, easy. Breathe deeply. What would you like to drink? I have tequila, whiskey, ginger-ale, red wine. - Again. - I asked what you want to drink. I have tequila, whiskey, ginger-ale, red wine... And again. We won't have a toast then! Does this happen often? What? My getting dizzy or the elevator breaking down? That you don't pay any attention to your wife when she talks. It's not what you're thinking. You revived, you devil! Ana's fine with me. I'm fine with Ana. So don't start with any of your tricks. Okay. Hello? He's not home. - Who was it? - It was for you. I thought you weren't here. - Are you having trouble? - Who was it? I don't know. He didn't want to leave a message. Don't answer the phone. Leave the answering machine on. Did you hear the message I left you? I leave it every morning. \"Your wife doesn't know what an orgasm is. Try harder\". - What's the matter? - I'm not a cardboard cutout! - Can I have a shower? - We can fuck right now! - Don't twist things, you moron! - You brought up orgasms. You're always dissatisfied. Not me. Don't twist things. I'm sick of you leaving me talking to myself. Excuse me, where can I take a bath? - Now you'll get one, darling. - Let me go! Let go of me! Stop! That's enough! The intellectual! You're so stupid and so blind. Excuse me. Where can I take a bath? Just what we needed. A man's balls. Hey, get dressed, asshole! Easy! I haven't taken a bath in five days. It's very European. Look, smell me. - Get away from me! - Come, I'll take you. No, you won't. I'll take him. He's taking me. Carlitos, which one is hot? Thanks. Carlitos! Show her she's wrong. Make a baby. Is she on the pill or what? Ana, why did you make that scene in front of Tomás? - Why? - For you everything is easy. I give you support when you need it. I disappear when you ask me to. Now I'm tired of it. What are you tired of? Say it. Answer me. What are you tired of? Of always being there for you. - So you can go with Tomás? - You don't understand a thing. No, answer me, damn it! Why did you let him go? He has a sense of humor. He knows how to make love. He has talent. You'd lose sleep for him, right? You're still in love with a clown. And don't tell me you are not because you know perfectly well that it's true. Why are you always jealous? Idiot! Because I will never be able to make love to you like him. Persephone! Andrea Maldonado. Pleased to meet you. - Married? - To an ape. There is always a second chance. No, I'm not attracted to Greeks. Thanks. I'm Roman. How would you like it if I threw you to the lions, Persephone? We're going to shoot the commercial in Ixtapa. Naoto Tekata will be your photographer. Who wants to come with me to the suite? - Me, me, me! - Excuse me a second. I've got a present for you. Let's see. Do you remember the slogan? Of course. - \"Comet sausages\". - \"Eat them, don't insert them\". Far out! Huge! All right, line up. Let's go. Come here, babe. You're with me, okay? Perfect. Let's see. All of it. Miguel? María! What are you doing here? Pissing myself. Can I go in alone or do I have to be with a group? Wipe your nose. Let Rome burn! Long live Mexico! - 22 hours? - 23. Nairobi, Frankfurt, New York, Immigration, Mexico. Nairobi? What were you doing so far away? We always said that as long as we stayed away from each other, we would make an excellent couple. Are you really interested? Remember, I'm a zoologist. Yeah, yeah. I haven't forgotten. Well, I was studying mandrills, chimpanzees, and my husband. You got married? That's good. Well, tell me, where's your husband? Dead and buried. I'm sorry. I didn't know. - What happened? - It's a metaphor, Miguel. I left him. Well, to be honest, I married him for a passport. Michael was English. Well, he is English. I never saw a man cry so much. The poor fool. Well, I don't know why I'm telling you all this. Must be that I haven't slept or that you make me nervous. How long are you going to be here in Mexico? I'm only here for a month, staying with a friend. I didn't want to go to San Luis, you know my family. Afterward I'm going to work at the San Diego Zoo. I don't know how they knew about me. They offered me a lot of money although they only have one mandrill. I don't need to go to San Diego, this place is full of animals on the loose. Why didn't you make the film? Everything was ready. Well, María, it's just that... Now I'm working at an advertising agency. You're not! Yeah, in fact this is a company party. María, one has to survive, change, adapt. Damn, you understand me, don't you? Besides tell me, who makes films in this country? Who? Unfortunately the closest thing is publicity, isn't it? At least we work with ideas, with creativity, with what both you and I were always looking for. Social commitment? Besides, I married Andrea. She's my wife now. I have to provide her with certain comforts, luxuries, dresses, trips. You married Andrea Maldonado? Yeah. Why? Sorry, it's just that I never would've... She was the most... You're still handsome. If you're tired, I can take you home. Look at that, just for a change. My friend Marisa never changes. Can I stay at your place? You disappointed me so much That I left you a blank check In your name Put whatever amount you want And where it reads \"worthless\" That must be your price And it's signed by me More! More! More! More! Is this why you dragged me out of the party? - Did you find it? - Yes. Here it is. Look Andrea, it's an original from the Rioguashasha tribe. Why are you driving so slowly? Can't you see that María is dying to go to bed? Hey Miguel, really. If it's too much trouble I can go to a hotel. I don't know any hotel. That is near here. - It's just that I don't think... - Don't think about anything! Relax! We want you to stay with us! Miguel has explained everything to me. You're going to be very comfortable in the spare room. Since we still don't have children, the apartment is a little big for us, isn't it, darling? Faster! Can't you see the lady wants to get there? Stop! I said stop! Sneaking in on me? Why are you so undisciplined girl? Because of this. If Muhammad doesn't go to the mountain... Muhammad jumps into my bed, right? What kind of a Muslim are you? I was also thinking about how to sneak into your room. But I don't think I ever got to... - Carlos? - Don't worry. He's not here. He went out. We haven't talked for so long. How are you? Impressed. I've never been inside the forbidden city. They belong to Carlos' mom. The vases, the plates, the lamps, the carpets, well, even the apartment is hers. That damn habit of leaving the window open. I still love you. Come here. This is my home, isn't it? What is this? His name is Cirilo. And if you think I'm jealous, well I'm not. On the contrary, I'm optimistic. She was the love of your life, wasn't she? Maybe she can talk you out of the mistake you're living in. Marrying you was my mistake. Now let me get some sleep. Although maybe you don't like her anymore. She doesn't have a soda smile, or coconut-oil legs. No, she's not the kind of woman you like now. So jealous, really jealous, well no, I can't be. Although maybe she is more stupid than me and still thinks she can do something about a lost cause. Darling, I'm begging you. Let's get some sleep. Come off it! As if you could sleep with all that coke you snorted. Do you think I don't notice when you're stoned? Damn it! Turn that fucking light off! Do you remember when you used to be sweet and patient with me? And would tell me you'd explain the world to me? When did you go numb? Hey, what if we try acupuncture? Do you think unhappiness can be cured with needles? I'm going to the living room. Or to fuck that bitch María? You'll wake her! Shut up. Because I want to talk? Miguel, I've been ironing your shirts for five years and you can't grant me one night's talk? Do you only talk to your secretary? Why don't you shut your mouth? - Let me go, Miguel. - Spread your legs. Let me go! Since you've kept me awake, I'm going to make a sacrifice to dissuade you from talking anymore, you fool. You are an animal! I always sleep with an animal. With an animal, right. With a hyena! A wife! Let go! Spread your legs. Damn it, spread your legs. Remember, Andrea, in bed there is always one who is stronger! And there is always one who winds up underneath the other! You've woken Cirilo. You left the window open. As always. Good night. Why? Why do I feel so jealous? It's disgusting. Couldn't you sleep? Me neither. She's still drunk. What happened to you, Miguel? Do you have a cigarette? You didn't smoke, either. No. She drives me insane. Insurgentes South Avenue around University City is completely blocked. We recommend you use an alternative route such as San Jerónimo, Periférico, or Revolución Avenue. Pollution monitoring reports... Fifty dead birds around San Jerónimo Avenue. Skin eczema on two nurses in General Hospital. And a man run over while boarding a bus. Now! Faster! Now! Now! Was that okay? - Ramiro! - Miguelito! How are you? I want to introduce you to Carlos Celorio. He has a great business proposal for you. Thanks. This city has really changed. It's like Wall Street. Here. I already know what I'm having. - Andrea... - It's my first time here. I can't suggest anything. Why do you let him treat you like this? It's none of your business. Serrano steak! I haven't had that in years. - It's awful here. - Would you like to order? A Serrano steak for the lady and a Grilled Red snapper for me. No broccoli. Aren't we going to wait for Miguel? Don't take too long. We're in a hurry. Do you know there are species that cannot reproduce when they are in captivity? What an interesting conversation! The sensation of being locked up makes the males violent and the females enraged. Mandrills are capable of killing each other under those circumstances. Are you trying to tell me something? - Why did you come here? - That doesn't matter. What do you mean it doesn't matter? Remember the Minotaur? The strange creature that's half bull, and now half publicist? Well, that creature used to devour women. If it didn't, it would die. Do you understand? - You have to... - Keep listening to you with my mouth open, right? Yes, I know you went to college. I'm going to the bathroom. What's with her? Sorry María, I was with Ramiro Hernández. María, the Director of the Commercial Bank. The other day, I beat him playing golf. My best 18 holes, three under pair. He's so selfish, Pilar! You just found out, honey? They're all selfish, Susana. He is not the problem, you are, darling. He's never going to change. - So what do I do then? - Cheat on him. - What? - Yeah. - Do it with somebody else. - I can't. Let me explain something. Men's main problem is their ego. It's such a big problem that just once is not enough. You have to do it at least twice a week. I don't dare, Pilar. He says... He says that I've got beans for tits. All right, enough. Didn't you fancy Charlie Celorio? He is outside at a table in this restaurant. Go and ask him to shout you to some maguey worms. Besides he's been promoted to chief of finances. - If I get caught? - You get divorced. - No! - Isn't that what you want? - Andrea! - Please, be more careful! Ramiro Hernández! My loan! I'll be back. Get your oranges, sweet oranges, oranges from Guerrero. Ten oranges for 20 pesos. Madam, bring your bag. Sweet oranges, get your oranges. One more! Hey. Where are you taking that? No! Cirilo! Cirilo! What the hell is going on with you? What is going on with me? I was at the stadium. Didn't you see us? We were there. - Of course I saw you! - Why didn't you say hello? Fucking cynic. Get the hell out of my house. Hey. Easy, easy, wait, wait. Did you hurt yourself, honey? The carpet! This will come out with mineral water. Let's try. Stick your mineral water up your ass! Hey. Where are your manners? Where are yours, you whore! Hey, don't Carlos! Carlos. Ana, wait, don't go. Wait. Let's get this straight. What did you see at the stadium? You two were kissing! - She started it. - You were spying on us? No, wait. Just a moment! That's a very naughty thing to do, Carlitos. - Seek and you shall find. - You son of a bitch! - Just get out now! - All right, all right. All right. Carlitos it is with great sorrow that I see that you haven't changed. Not a bit. You have to control your anger. Asshole! Carlitos. Let me give you a piece of advice. You should listen to me. You're stuck in the same place. I'm tired of telling you: Ana will not eat you alive. But she's a nympho obsessed. Why else would she kiss you? She wants you to look at her! It's obvious! You don't pay her any attention. I've told her a thousand times. I can give her other things, but all she thinks about is... Marzipan? Well, give it to her. Why are you so selfish? - One moment! - Stay out of this! Ana told me she wants you to be less resistant. Carlitos, stop thinking about yourself all day long. What she needs is a lover, and that's not me. I can't only be thinking about... - Carlitos. - Stop calling me Carlitos! You can but you won't. I've tried, but she always wants more. - It's an excuse. - Shut up, you both! I'm the only one who knows what I need. And you know what I need? Fresh air! Ana. See what you've done? Don't worry about me. I'm leaving too. - You're leaving with her? - Don't worry. I don't want to have anything to do with women. You're both together in this. Where are you going? New York? - Get out of my way, damn it! - Moron! Andrea. Forgive me. I don't know why it happened. Since what happened with Michael I feel... Forget it. There is nothing between Miguel and me. And there never will be. Andrea, don't give up on yourself, you're all you've got. I'll get my things. Don't worry, it's not your fault. It's the straw that broke... Please, call me at my office before you leave for San Diego. See you. Thanks. - You forgot this. - Thanks. Carlos, I want to apologize. I'll send you my new address later. Where shall I take you, young man? - To prison, please. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hang on! You can stay! Miguel was always talking about you. You two used to write to each other? Once. More than five years ago he wrote me a letter. I think he wasn't even married to you yet. That's all. In bed he called me María many times. The day he went to my family's house to ask for my hand he called me María. You don't know how much I hated you. Don't worry. I'm not offended. I had no idea about any of this. Look, I know this is going to sound ridiculous, but stay. What? I don't want you to go with him to New York! - He told you that? - Yes. Well, no. But he's going to invite you to go there or something else. I know him. I'm so stupid. I'm so stupid, such an idiot. Damn! Hello, Miguel. Going away on vacation? - Carlitos! How are you? - Fine. And you? Good, good, me too. No, no. I'm not going away on vacation. About the dinner... - It was tomorrow, wasn't it? - Yes. Well, it's off. We can't do it. Don't worry, Ana had some problems herself and went on a trip too. - Where are you going? - I don't know, to a hotel. While I find an apartment. - I broke up with Andrea. - What? And you better pay the phone bill. It's still in my name! As for the rest, you can starve to death! You'll be in a lot of trouble if you dare throw away my mail! - Miguel. - Yes. - Is Andrea in? - Yes. Thanks. - Hey, Carlitos. Ana and you... - We're through. Bitch. Do you know what she's going to do? She's going to go to Andrea and... Why don't you stay with us for a few days? - No, no. - Why pay for a hotel room? No. Besides, I don't want to know anything about Andrea. We'll close the curtains. They say you're a great cook. Me? No way, not at all. Later. Let's have a drink. Just one. Girls, follow me! Miguel, I'd like you to meet Tomás. Let me see. Trio of overexposed emancipated women. Clarita. With you and without a husband life is going to be so much easier. Let's make a toast! - To men! - Fuck off! I mean, as bastards. Right, sister? Cheers! Look, they don't even know how to drink. Within half an hour they'll either be crying or throwing up. Gorgeous eyes! Do you think God meant to create women this way or was it another of His little mistakes? Little? He really screwed us. Carlitos, what do you think? You think God... He's levitating. Is the music ready, Andrea? That's the way. Look, Clarita, this is how to move. Look, Clarita, like this. Put that away. Now. Look. Like this. Do you know that science has demonstrated that there are - only three types of men? - My father, my sugar daddy, - and those idiots. - No, no, no. One: Those who promise what they'll never give you. I've been promised quite a few things. Two: Men who want you to be a lady at the table and a whore in bed. Could that be it? I've always been a lady in bed and a whore at the table. No, and three. I said three: Those who look for a mother like beggars. - Those men are the worst. - Come here, girls, look! Carlitos. Where are you? Come here. Sure. The problem with fucking women is that they don't understand that monogamy makes us miserable. Resignation, Miguel. That's God's will. No, that's not God's work. You say that because you're promiscuous. no, no, no. I'm sorry, buddy, but which God are you talking about? I don't mess around with your God, don't mess around with mine. I want to explain something, Carlitos. Stop calling me \"Carlitos\". All right, Mr. Carlos. Let me tell you that I change my woman because I want an ear, not because I'm promiscuous. - What? - Yes, yes, yes. An ear. A virgin ear which enjoys, finds pleasure in and appreciates my wonderful stories. I make love because I'm a very sociable person. But what I really like, what I really like is masturbation. Come, come. FIRST CALL Did you see their stupid faces? Second demonstration of science: If men had an IQ proportionally larger than the size of their dicks they would be capable of understanding something. Hey, Ana, and Carlos, is it big? His IQ? Yeah. Madam, what is an IQ? I'll be damned. Brother. What are you doing, man? Don't I look good in my Armani? No, no, let's see here, out. Know what? There are two things women can do very well. One is taking their stockings off, and two, - taking up all our time. - And the clitoris, Miguelito? - What about it? - What do you mean, Miguel? Why do they hide it? Honestly, how many hours of your life have you wasted trying to find a clitoris? Tomás, I've never found a clitoris. Where have you been looking? Second curtain call. They're pigs! He and his friends. Look, they were here every Saturday. Emptying my refrigerator and farting all the house. No, no, no, what a pleasure it was to go to the toilet and sit on the seat splattered with piss. Disgusting! Third scientific truth: The way they pee is how they see the world. They're vulgar. That's what they are! Hey, stop it! That's enough! I can't understand how they can roll around in a tub with a whore or two and then, so easily get into our bed with us. No. They are perverted, degenerate, sex maniacs, sons of... Don't drink anymore, Andrea. But it's true! The only thing they think about when they are with a woman is fucking her. Well, it's logical. They're pure instinct. They're mammals. He's here! I feel like I'm in Amsterdam. Where's the popcorn? Can't you see? Charlie, they're trying to seduce us! - Should we forgive them? - Pussy! Pussy! Pussy! - Hi. - Hi. Is Carlos home? He asked me for this book. He's out jogging. He won't be long. Want to wait in here? - Are you alone? - Yes. Alone, alone. Excuse me. I need some suits. Is anyone there? Yes. Ana and Andrea are home. I don't know what you are doing there, María. I have breakfast, lunch, sometimes I clean up. And I cheer Andrea up. She needs to recover. Yeah? And that's why she needs you. Yes. She knows I know you. Hey, women have very few advantages, we don't have any choice but to be smarter than men. As a first step, your wife is learning the subtle art of indifference. She doesn't hate you anymore. You don't know how grateful I am. Excuse me. I'm going to change. - Miguel. - Yes? Could you be interested in me again? After all that's happened? What had to happen, happened. - Could you? - No. Why? María, Everything's changed. I told you that since I arrived, you're no longer the same. Yes, I'm not the same. Your self-assurance, your theories, and your invulnerability no longer impress me. Now I like to live with people who make mistakes. May I finish getting dressed? And if we tried again? Doesn't that sound nice? Coming! I'm coming! - Hi. - Hi. - I'm looking for Ana. - She's sleeping. - You want me to wake her? - No, no. - May I come in? - Yes. Comfy, right? Can I offer you something to drink? Do you have some ice? Come on, Andrea. You can't deny me some ice, can you? Tomás, what do you want? - Do you like it? - What? The name Tomás. My real name is Francisco Tomás Rulfo de Calabria. Really. No, I'll have to ask you not to drink in my house. - Especially at this hour. - All right, all right. You're right. \"Just for today\". Sorry, but you'll have to leave. Look at me. I have to get dressed and Ana is not going to get up. - Okay. - Please. You know that making love in the kitchen is an offering - to the gods of the house? - Tomás. Really. The god of fire, the god of bread, the god of jelly, the goddess of butter... The god of mashed potato. The god of stew. The kitchen is the paradise where love boils! Tomás! Men are shit, aren't they? That hypocrite! And I thought she was my friend. Andrea. Are you going out like that? - Andrea. - What? I'm not like other men. I do believe in women. That's why when I see all those men grabbing all the money, intelligence, power, everything. When I see Miguel being such a pig, do you know what I feel? I feel deeply disgusted. Hollow. Ashamed of myself. Believe me, Andrea. I can help you. I want to help you. Hey! What's all the noise! Miguel! What are you doing here? I came for some suits. Is Andrea in? She's in her room. Come in. Do you want a drink? No. Miguel! When do you need the pictures you asked me for? In a week. And tell Andrea that I've canceled her card. I'm not paying for her beauty parlor or for her shopping. That's ironic. She's probably gone to the beauty parlor or shopping. Put something on. Bye. Easy, easy, Miguel. You son of a bitch. I came looking for you but you were sleeping like a baby. Shut your mouth! At times the caterpillar has been considered a very harmful plague in the world of agriculture. - Don't change it! - Okay. Can you pass me the salt? Thanks. It tastes good, good, good. Shut up, will you? What if we forget about women? Because of them we've been about to kill each other. We? I was relaxed, but this guy wanted... I said shut up, damn it! Go on. Our lives don't satisfy us. Our love relationships are precarious, mediocre or they simply do not exist. I think that the most convenient thing to do now is to turn... - Gay. - No! Chaste. - Chaste? - Yes. - As in saintly? - Yes. - You mean... - Yes, Ana, yes. Well. But they can still call us on the phone? - No. - Send us a fax? No. It's all or nothing. My God. Andrea, for the tenth time. I don't know what you saw through the window, but I told you Miguel and me did absolutely nothing. Don't be such an extremist! Are you with me or against me? With you. Whose apartment is this? Yours. From now on, in this apartment, entry to men is forbidden. Because I say so. I don't think it's such a bad idea. Andrea! Look. Ana, let me put it this way: Not one man for three months. - Make it two. - Three. It's for our own good, girls. Let's drink a toast! Through chastity, we will find the way to happiness. My God, why have you forsaken us? It's been more than fifteen minutes. There are people who stay like this for more than fifteen days. So what? Do they get a prize? I have a meeting at the office. See you. Brother, I just can't. I can't hack this Zen thing. Especially with this smog. It's impossible with this dust. - I'll drive you. - No, you sit down. Yes, mother Carlotta. It's your turn to make dinner, Tomás. Yes, auntie, bring me home a gram, please. Of baking soda, I'll make a cake. NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT VIRTUAL REALITY IS? Where are you going? I need no more meditation. I'll fuck and suck because the world's about to end. You won't find what you're looking for by fucking. Explain yourself. - Don't you get it? - Get what? You're not going to get anywhere like this. Tomás, you spend your life fucking as if you score a point for every lay. Your philosophy is \"If you like it, do it, with whomever and whenever you please\". - Aren't you scared? - Scared? Of what? - Of becoming hollow. - Don't talk crap. It's not crap, Tomás. For years you've been dumping your energy into the gutter. Deep down, you are terrified of being seen the way you really are. Nothing to say? I'm going to hang out my laundry. I've got a lot. Spicy food can awaken your lower instincts. In India, there are three types of foods: Satvic, Rajasic and Tamasic. Spicy food, as our guide tells us, excites the palate and inspires gluttony, the twin sister of lust. Spiritual purity begins in the stomach. Pure foods. For example, the grain of corn used in pozole is not eaten right away, instead... She's not translating, she's making things up. I'm off. - Do you have more lemon? - Ana, we agreed we were not... What, mother superior? You didn't hear what our guide said about spicy food? Pig! Your macrobiotic food has produced pimples on my back and my butt. Thanks, handsome. She doesn't understand a thing. You know what she did last night? - What? - Masturbate. I heard her from my room. Well, it's really hard for her. She used to fuck every day. With Carlos? That nerd? No way. Sex has nothing to do with the head. That's what their fighting is all about. The worst part is that sex always wins over head. I'm beginning to crave pork rinds. Hey, no! You can both get fucked! Hey what's the lecture about, miss? Andrea! Tomás, I'm still meditating. And I have to hang up all these clothes, clean up the rooms and the bathroom, and turn the oven on for the cake. You don't have to, if you don't want. I love it, ma'am. I love seeing how we're becoming queer. You can't handle silence. Look at it this way. Silence is the basis of sound. Continence is the basis of sex. Stop acting like a moron! Listen to me, Carlitos! Listen very carefully. I got involved in this shit to help you and Miguel. You two were falling apart, not me, Carlitos. It's very easy to blame it all on those poor bitches of women. But, no. Love is not like that. When you love someone, you open yourself up. Otherwise, nothing happens. What I saw here a month ago, was something completely different. Ana and you couldn't talk to each other. Now do you understand why she left? Tomás! What's up? Can I turn my radio on now, madam? Mr. Mendizábal, here's the original. They took the moon out and changed the blue. Can you authorize it? - Sir? - Later. Roy can't give the work order until you do this. - Didn't you hear me? - Yes. - I'm going to change the music. - No, Tomás! I can't iron to this. Carlitos. I need some cognac and a gram. There's some rum in the cupboard. You know I love you, don't you? You were right, Tomás. She only asked me to touch her. What are you waiting for? You only have to cross the street. Forget it! I'll never really know anything about women. What the hell do you want to know? I don't understand why a magazine assigns me an essay about love, when I don't have a fucking clue about it! Why am I the way I am? Look, a hieroglyphic. Why don't we try again, Michael? Michael. Michael! No, I'm not shouting, Michael! But... Yes, but... I love you. Please. I've changed a lot, believe me. Believe me. I've changed a lot. I can take the first flight. Michael. But... Michael, No. No! No, don't hang up on me, Michael! The South African? He is English. The one you married for the passport? Shut up, will you? Love doesn't exist, isn't that so, doctor? Leave me alone. Why did you tell us you left him? Because that's how it was. You were crying and pleading. Look, I know what you're thinking. Why do you want to be cold and calculating? I don't know. I do. Because you want to be like them. - In order to fight against them. - Against yourself. We're women, María. You're very pretty. What are you laughing about? Nothing. It's just that us ugly women find it funny - to be told that we look pretty. - You're not ugly. No, not that ugly. But you're a woman. What's that got to do with it? Our two options: Pretty or tossed aside. Know what we should do? Demand the same right that men have to be ugly. But you're not ugly. Then tell me why every time those damn men look at me I feel they either pity me or they spurn me! Forget it. And I'm not going back to Michael. Even if he begs me to. Do either of you two know what an orgasm is? No. Wait, wait. Who's that? I don't know. It's in Belize. And this one? Let's see. This one, I met her at a convention in Acapulco, I think. Maybe not. Who the hell knows! - You don't remember anyone. - Stop bothering me, pal! This one looks as if you took her out of... Yeah, probably, man. Help yourselves. Tomás, your cake turned out divinely! I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm about to leave and none of you have said anything about my new earrings. My vase! God! I'm your mother and you couldn't bring a vase to my house. I have no vases! Son. What a shame! I don't understand. I don't understand anything. Listen to me. If you break one single thing, I'll kick the three of you out of here. Besides, you should open the windows. It smells like a funeral in here. - What are you burning? - Not this one, please! - Not this one, please. - Tomás, stop being a clown. If you break it... It's from the Ming dynasty. Tomás, give my mother that vase. - I don't want to! - Grow up! All right, all right. Okay. Okay. We're being dispossessed, Cirilo, violently. No! He lives in there? And his name is Cirilo! Mom. The chauffeur is waiting for you. The chauffeur! He's so handsome. I'm about to exchange this boy's father for him. A woman like me doesn't enjoy sleeping in separate beds. - Mom, please. - He is hypnotized by the TV. - That's how it is, Carlos. - Yes, mom. I expect you to call your uncle about that job. If you two really were his friends, you would at least take him to a strip joint. Darling, when will you wake up? Carlos, there is a world out there. - Mom. - What? Come. - I need some... - Money? I know. I deposited it into your account yesterday. Get a haircut, you look dreadful. Carlitos, your mother supports you? She pays for some things. Ana used to pay for everything. Lucky you arrived, Miguel, now you can help. I've got a scholarship. - Nice little piece! - Let me see. She is my mother, you asshole. You lay her too, or you don't remember? - Stop it, Tomás. - I had never met someone more promiscuous than me. I didn't do it out of lust, you prick. Sure, you did it to help. Don't talk crap, Miguel. No, really. I slept with them because I wanted to know if I was still able to fall in love. Seriously. I wanted to know if... I don't know, maybe with one of them... Forget it, man. With one of them what, Miguelito? Nothing, nothing. What about Andrea? He always hurt me. Ana, please! He never cared. Or rather I guess he never knew. He always thought I screamed from pleasure. - You never tried to... - My vagina is too tight. What did you feel? Well, at first it hurt a lot, and then nothing. Well, yes, I did feel something. I felt dead inside, lying there with him pushing up and down and squeezing me. Andrea, you don't have to go on. And then, you know what would I think? I would think that I was another woman. That the body that Miguel was penetrating wasn't mine. It was one of his many little girl friends. It was then when I looked at him. I'd see how he enjoyed it. He looked so beautiful. Well, yes. I slept with them out of lust. We hardly talked. We'd just fuck. No, that's not true, they talked. They'd tell me intimate things. You know, that's how women are. And I, well... I told them jokes, my anecdotes, male things. I mean, nothing. When they started getting too inquisitive, I would stop seeing them. Too inquisitive about what? I don't know. The truth. About how inept, empty and superficial I am. Ah, you guys are way too dramatic. Let's go to the movies. - Later, Tomás. - \"Later, Tomás\". Why the fuck do you have to justify everything? Yes, Miguel, we know you betrayed your ideals. Everything you thought you could do went down the drain. But you're all right. You're successful, you have lots of money. And a lot of women to sleep with. Do you know what it feels like to ejaculate and want to dress and get the hell out? Why do we only think about fucking, fucking and fucking? Who makes us believe in orgasms? In my case, for example, I've always known that my mind and my partners', any woman's, are thousands of miles apart. My God! Poor Andrea, why did she marry this cripple? Sometimes... Sometimes I wish I could be twelve again. Too much sanctity in this place. I've had it. I'm off. I'm going to kick that son of a bitch in the balls! Miguel is not to blame for everything in your life. This came for you. I forgot. Who brought it? - A messenger. - Messenger? Miguel! - Voodoo? - No. He's given me one every month, to cheer me up, according to him. I've always wanted a child. But I'm sterile. He must be feeling guilty. He can go to hell. Do you think anything is really going to change? Because we've been here, like nuns for two weeks now. No, no. It was her idea, not mine. I'm not talking about that, Ana. A little less sex doesn't hurt anyone. Sex, sex is the key to the world. I don't deny it. I'm crazy about orgasms. That little explosion in which one can find the meaning to everything. Stop exaggerating. No, no, Andrea, to me it's like... Like a picture! It's about collecting moments. That's what life is about, isn't it? What about Carlos? With him it was very strange. He would get aroused, but it was as if he could feel no pleasure. Do you know what he used to tell me? \"Ejaculating is like blowing your nose\". His stupid mind was always somewhere else. He lived locked in his questions like in a jail. Well, no. I must admit that there were days, many days, when he was so attentive, so sensitive. He used to tell me so many things. You see... he was an excellent lover in the sentimental aspect, but a failure in the technical one. What a pity. He was a great catch. \"Trio of stupid women in search for lost time\". Go and find him. There's still hope for you two. For example, Venice is like a whore, very old and with lots of makeup. But Prague is mysterious. It's a mystical city, like you. Wait a second. I'll be right back. - Hi, what's your name? - Patricia. I don't know Patty, I was thinking. Can you imagine a society without excrement? It would be wonderful. All the shit would dissolve inside our body and the crap would never come out. We would never feel guilty. Yeah, how nice. It would be wonderful, wouldn't it? I wouldn't have to feel like an asshole after having thrown ten years of my life down the toilet. Why are you dancing alone? Want to dance with me? Yes sure. Let's go. I'll be straight with you. I don't want you to be offended. Do you need something more than physical attraction to go to bed with me? What's your story? - You're crazy. - No wait, wait. I get it. You're like all Mexican women. You need time. How long? Five years? I'll wait. I don't like you. What's more, you're pathetic. Could you fall in love with me or do you think I'm a clown? No, please don't get serious. I can't stand serious people. If you and I were more honest, we would already be fucking, without so much beating around without so much protocol or so much fuss. Don't go. Don't leave! I only wanted to know if... Dance with me! Isn't there anyone here who can love me for a little while? No. I'm behaving myself. No. No. That place really hops, doesn't it, mister? Hi. Hi. Sorry. Why don't you go up? Carlos has been waiting for you for over a month. He adores you. I don't dare. Me neither. How scary. The Moon. What's the matter? Nothing. I'm finished. You're not finished. You just have to start again. With you? You're drunk. Let's go, I'll help you up. Come on. It's stuck. No. Here, this way. Okay, Tomás, enough. You'll wake up the neighbors. We're here. Open the door. I don't have the strength. You open it. - Give me the key. - I don't have it. I don't have anything. They've got me locked up in here. Today I escaped again. You do love me, don't you? Of course I love you. No, Tomás. No more. Hold me. Please, hold me. Come here, come here. There. It's okay. What's the matter with you two? Are you sick? - Wait, Tomás is... - Don't interfere! What's going on? - Why did you pick up Ana? - He didn't come looking for me. I found him downstairs drunk and helped him up the stairs. Stay on the stairs. You're not coming in here. What's your problem, little writer? I haven't touched Ana because she came looking for you. Feel lucky, fucking idiot. You don't have to miss her, because Ana's with you, not me. Fucking eunuch. It's okay Miguel. Don't worry so much. I love women too. I'm happy with anyone who desires my body. I'm not worried. Fucking cynic. If you were capable of loving you'd care! It's easy to call each other \"darling,\" to have pictures of the children who already go to school. Why do you need this wonderful woman for? To show her off during dinner with your friends. Is that what love is, you little writer? I pity you. The sex machine won't shut up. Calm down already! - Tomás! - Calm down! Do you remember? Do you remember? \"Nothing we find satisfies us. Nothing. It only lasts for a few moments and then it's gone\". - Bravo! - Stop it, both of you! Enough. It's your phrase. That's the first thing I heard when I came to this apartment and peeked in through that door. So, hypocrite? You know what life is all about? Are you all right? Let me go! Explain it to me! I don't have a fucking clue! Do whatever you want. Your problems no longer interest me. Sure. I'm always the story nobody was interested in. Only the birds. So, as soon as I can, I fly away. Poor you. How romantic. Now, get out. What a shame that my only friend has changed so much. Take care of Cirilo. Tomás! Tomás! Tomás! EARTH DWELLERS, YOUR PLANET STINKS - Write to me. - I promise. And are you coming to visit me in San Diego? I promise. Although, well, now that I've got my job, well... I don't know if I'll be able to. - They gave it to you? - I start on Monday. - Congratulations. - Thank you, thank you. - Thanks for everything. - Thank you. Bye. Have a good trip. Andrea. Remember, you only have yourself. I'm going to miss you. I came for the rest of my things. - May I come in? - Yes, sure. The movers may come up for the bed. I've cleared all my things out. The keys are on the bed. Good-bye. No, no, Miguel. No more. And if we were to try again? Doesn't that sound nice? Good-bye, Miguel. I'm leaving now. Here. Take this with you. - They published it? - Yes. Page 19. \"Sex, Shame and Tears\". Sex? Do you know what sex is? Ana. The cover. Are they coming for his things today? Yes. His brother. He told me to take care of him. Right, Cirilo? When I get the phone on, I'll send you the number. Okay. Bye. Bye. - Will you forgive me? - Will you forgive me? What are you looking at? Your ass. And this miracle? I want to make love to you. What are you on? Cry-baby. Bashful. - Someone's ringing the bell. - Don't worry about it. Darling, the whole neighborhood will see us. Who's being chaste now? I love you. It's going to be tomorrow. Let's go. MOVING COMPANY\n"

      "- What was that? - Call an ambulance! OPERATING THEATER I'm sorry. I did all I could. Mr Alain Revent? Yes? Your wife just died. Who are you? Inspector Leroy, National Police. It happened in public, hence police involvement. Those are the rules. {\\an8}CONCLUSION, IT WAS SUICIDE {\\an8}CONCLUSION, IT WAS SUICIDE? Before concluding this case, some personal details. Born on the...? 27th August 1942. During the war. - In Zurich. - Address. Zurich, 253 Baumstrasse. Profession? No profession. Yes, I'm an annuitant. There are still a few of us left in Switzerland. We didn't have the war. Will you please sign at the bottom of the page? No, thanks. \"Baumstrasse, 1942.\" Why did you do that? Sorry? No, nothing. Those were your wife's last words. Good! Sorry for keeping you. The case is definitively closed. - Goodbye, Mr Revent. - Goodbye. Young lady? You saw her jump? As I see you now, and the husband came to the balcony. And he was making a strange face. A strange face? He was smiling. He was smiling? He was smiling. Which disease did she come to see you about? Insomnia. It's not a disease. It's more of a symptom. An overworked nervous system. I prescribed barbiturates. We found no trace of those in her blood. She may have stopped taking them. Perhaps she no longer needed them? Her stress disappears and she kills herself? Is that logical to you? Little is known about the inner workings of the brain. Between her wedding and suicide, six months. So what? People get married, think they'll be happy, they're not. You see it all the time. Believe me, we have enough hardcore crime on our hands. If we open investigations for all women who aren't happily married and lock up their husbands, there won't be many men left on the street. So, let's be serious. Very good, boss. DEAD END Is it early? No, it's late! I won't be home for eight days. Thank you. Good night! Hello? Who? My scarf? Yes! I must have left it somewhere. Ah, yes, back there! Thanks! How did you know it was my scarf? I recognized your perfume. Forgive me for calling so late. Of course, it could wait. But... I needed to talk to someone. I forgive you. I won't keep you long. I'll come over with your scarf. Oh, no! Not here. Do you know the London Tavern? Tomorrow at six, that's not too late? No, that's great. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. What will madam have? A Martini, please. - Very good, madam. - Thank you! Your eyes are... green? I thought they were blue. That long coat. It looked like a lapdog! I have an old bottle of William Lawson here. I'll open it in your honor! Thank you! We need a phosphorescent coat. Oh, wow! Come on. Listen, you're in a hurry to leave. - You forgot a very important errand. - Me? Tell me, is this the first time you've been here? Call me! Tell me everything! Thank you. Thanks. Is it eleven already? I have a very important errand to run. I must leave. What? You're leaving already? Well, yes. Bye, darling! Thank you! - Goodbye, Alain. - See you soon. He's gone on holiday. Understandable. After what happened to him, he'll want a change of scene. Good evening, madam! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! See you tomorrow. Hello, madam! I've left my dog upstairs, please ask your wife to feed him. - Indeed, okay! - Goodbye! Don't worry, madam! Is Mr Alain Revent here? No, madam, Mr Revent left very early this morning. And you wouldn't know... When he's due back? No, madam. We'll check that later. - Hello. - Hello! The other night, you were so elegant! Thanks to you! You? At ten in the morning? Don't tell me, I've guessed. Arlette? No interruptions, please. Right, madam. There's no middle ground with love. It either tires you or awakens you. With you, it's the latter. So, spill! Vincent called me from Lyon. Just so you know, I'll be in Paris on Monday evening. I'm not sure I'll be here. Jacqueline's invited me out. Understood! - Hello? Florence? - Yes, madam? If Mr Vincent Bersson calls from Lyon, I'm in Chantilly. Tell Chantilly I'm out in the forest with Miss Nathalie Ferreri. Very good, madam! Thanks! Right now, I can't bear seeing him. It's that serious? I think so. You seem so sad, you should be very happy! I'm glad you came. We've never lied to one another, I don't want to start now. We've become... a habit for one another. I didn't even know... that I was bored. You will be most unhappy. Maybe that's what happiness is. Oh, I'm so happy. As per your instructions, I passed through Zurich. I was able to see her. I told her what was going on in your life. She looked at me, fixedly, not saying a word. I think you should pay her a visit, at least every once in a while. Magnificent! He's handsome, he's married you, and even more unbelievably, he respects you. Too much! Before returning to Geneva, we should talk for a few minutes. Not possible, we're leaving. Well, in that case, let me sum up your financial situation... I'm not interested. I was happy to bring you up to speed. - Especially since... - Excuse me. So nice of you to come. I got your invitation. Excuse me. - Congratulations. - Thank you. You're the guilty culprit. Nathalie, my dear. Do you mind? Yes, I met my wife for the first time in your waiting room. You were our matchmaker. That's rare in the police. My friend, Mr Wassermann, a notary in Geneva. Inspector Leroy. Nice to meet you. Keep a close eye on the inspector. Keep him in your sights and do not let him escape. I'm not used to this kind of ceremony. Should I perhaps greet the family? Our friend has only his mother left. Where is she? She has stayed in Zurich. Yes, I understand. If a mother doesn't attend her son's wedding, it's perhaps because she doesn't approve of the marriage? She doesn't disapprove of it either. Why did you want it to be here? I don't know. There must be a reason. Kiss me. Answer me. I don't know. A whim. You're lying! Alain! You want to drive me mad. Me? I don't understand. You pretend not to understand. If I've hurt you, I didn't mean to. Please forgive me. Alain! You've ruined everything! Alain! Since Paris, you... you haven't said a word. Please, don't talk about it. Be happy. I love Venice. I want you to love it, too. My dear, I had asked you to buy him his birthday present. Oh, Alain! How are you? Are you well? Alain, it's been a while since you came. Well? - Could you fetch me a champagne? - No. - Just one! - Well, then! How lovely to see you. I told the hotel to inform me once you'd arrived. My wife. Madam. Nice to meet you. It's an honor to have you here. Welcome to Venice and to my home. - Thank you. - Come, I'll introduce you to my wife. - Excuse me. - Of course. How's things? Come on. You have a stunning palace! Thank you. Francesca, my dear, Mrs Revent. Lovely to meet you! Do you mind? Madame. May I offer you a glass of champagne? - A whiskey, please. - A whiskey. Please don't hate me, I didn't recognize you. I'm hopelessly shortsighted. And the fashions in Paris can change women so dramatically and make them more beautiful every year. Thank you. So, what's new since last year? Remember, some of us friends had tea at your place. My place? At the Danieli. The Lucrezia Suite. I remember it well! Last year, you say? Your honeymoon was last year, wasn't it? You've been here on honeymoon before. It would appear so. It's not very original, Venice. You've probably chosen the same suite, the same room, the same bed. Coming? We're going for a drink. Yes. What do you want? - Champagne? - Yes. - Champagne. - Here you are, sir. Not at all. - Is that your wife? - Yes. Want to meet her? Yes. Come. Pigeon. Aren't you handsome! No. Good morning, my love. Hello, darling. Now, I know. Now, I'm certain that we're going to be happy. Now? Yes, you see... I needed that first night. You don't remember? Alain, I want to go back to Paris... Right away. To think of the face Palmieri will pull when he comes to get us from the hotel tonight. Mr and Mrs Revent? They've gone! Back to Paris. Where do you want us to go? - What would you enjoy? - Dinner with you. - Of course! - Alone with you. With no one around us. A restaurant with no one in is never a good restaurant. No matter. - Where, then? - Here. Great idea. Good. And buy what you want. At your service, ma'am. Good evening, darling. I'm kissing you, but I'm not so sure. Why? You could have told me you were back. I was going to. Liar. So, Venice? Lame. It's a city... how to put it... that's terribly aquatic. Hey, you don't look well. Who told you we were back? Alain. I bumped into Jacqueline while shopping. Yes, he was weigh-laden. He invited me over for a drink. Why? Does this not make you happy? Yes, of course! Darn! I left my car's hood down. It'll turn into a bathtub. Alain? Would you be a dear? Nobody forced him to marry you. So, he must love you. He loves you. There are moments where... I feel like I don't recognize him. You know... You don't understand a man better by making love to him. All done. Thank you, Alain. - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye. Don't walk me out, I know the way. - Bye, Jacqueline. - Night, Alain. I bumped into her, I couldn't... Yes, I know, of course. But you knew I wanted to be alone with you. I'll go. Sorry! My car won't start. Might Alain know of a mechanic in the area? At this hour, everywhere is closed. I'll take you home. I'm a whore. You wanted to know? Now you know. Will you be back? Never twice. Nice of you to come and wait for me. Give me the key. You want to leave? You want to leave me? But to leave me, you'll need the key. You want the key? Do you? I'll give you the key. Is there a reason she's in this state? No, none. Most nervous breakdowns in women are caused by married life. We should have her admitted to a neurological clinic in Neuilly. A peaceful place where she'll be both monitored... - I'll give her the best care. - As you wish. Beware of anorexia nervosa, which can be a form of suicide. She absolutely must keep eating. Without rushing her, be firm. I'll do all I can. Give me regular updates. Hey. What's new? I'm absolutely shattered. - Go and take a rest, then. - Thanks. Hello, boss. Inspector, there's someone waiting for you. Have a seat. I... I'm sure my visit comes as a surprise. What's going on? I'm scared. Scared of what? When my first wife killed herself, you suspected me, did you not? Why are you asking me that now? I think I attract and that I'm attracted to a certain type of woman. Nathalie slit her wrists. - Is she dead? - No. I saved her. When did this happen? Two weeks ago. Two weeks? - Yes, but the doctor said... - Dr Schwartz? No, a specialist, Mr Richet. Professor Richet? Yes. He said that some who attempt suicide try more than once. So, if by some misfortune that were to happen, I should hate one to think... - \"One\" being whom? - You. Where's your wife? At home. Who is with her? No one. Quickly go back to her. Mr Revent. Goodbye. - Meunier? - Yes, sir? With all the usual politesse, call in Professor Richet. Today, we need to make a general assessment. Only a blood count will allow us to make the best diagnosis. If you'd like to come this way, madam. No, we'll only be two or three minutes. Here it is, but... this is rather irregular. This is a very exceptional case. This woman is in danger. I have every reason to believe so. A deeper analysis will clarify that. - Thanks, Professor. - Goodbye, Inspector. Normal blood count. But trace presence of dextrorotatory phenylaminopropane tartrate. And what is that in layman's terms? The person is taking a psychoactive drug. Is it a poison? All or almost all drugs are poisons. It depends on the dose. A high dose of this would be particularly dangerous for a neurotic person. We need the mouse to reach a state of depression through fear. Is that possible? Of course. Thanks to conditioned responses. If we scare them every ten seconds it's psychotic fear. I followed your instructions. Watch. This is the control mouse. Non-conditioned, it behaves normally. Logical reflex, rapid, full of health. And how does the conditioned mouse behave? The reflex is worn out by too many alerts. It has become less fast, less violent. Now, I'd like to know whether it's possible to create a drug addiction within the sick one by treating depression. Of course. With a drug that is both calming and euphoric. That exists? Not long ago, you could get them without a prescription. Perfect for creating an ingrained habit. Yes, we call them subscription drugs. Once someone is used to them, they can't live without them. Can we see such an effect? Absolutely, it's very fast. Once drugged, the mouse will experience a state of euphoria. For how long? It varies, but as soon as the drugs wear off, discomfort will take over. The need for the drug becomes acute after how many days? I couldn't say a precise date, but in mice, it's a week. Right, okay. - I'll call you next Monday. - Okay. Goodbye. If you're in no doubt about the drug addiction, stop the experiment. I'll come by tomorrow. Look. It's dead. And yet... You didn't poison it. To the contrary, I weaned it off the drug. But its body needed it to survive. Cruelty causing depression to a pathological state. Then medication leading to drug addiction. You think so? I'm sure of it. Now, and herein lies the crime, he'll suddenly stop the drugs. Do you have proof? The lab is positive. Complete withdrawal could lead to suicide. - This man is a killer. - Oh, come on. His weapon is the deprivation of this drug. This woman needs it to live. You can't be serious. Can you see us in court being asked for evidence and all we can say is withdrawal? Who do you expect to convince? My superior. Me? I don't exist. I am just a relay in the judicial machine that enforces laws. There's a law that allows you to give me the green light. The one obliging us to help those in danger. First, you must prove she's in danger and she must call us. She will. I'll make sure she does. Don't \"make sure\" of anything. Don't overstep your rights. No provocation or zeal. Is it zealous to want to prevent a crime? We don't prevent crimes, we catch criminals. That's the law. - The law is stupid. - Possibly. Do you realize how stupid that sounds? Do you realize who you're talking to? By your reasoning, we should wait for this woman to be killed before we help her. That's appalling. That's how it is. If you don't like it, resign. No! I'll wait till I'm fired! And I promise you I won't go quietly! I'll wake up people's consciences. I forbid you from pursuing this investigation based on accusations. I'll pursue it till the very end. If things get tricky, I won't support you. I'll do without you. That's dangerous. So be it. Stubborn, aren't you? But, I think, were this woman not so pretty, you mightn't be so determined to protect her. - I hope you're joking. - Of course I am. If Mrs Revent presses charges, you and I will be covered. Inform me as soon as you're successful. I'd rather inform you now. I'll do what I think I have to do, even if I'm mistaken, even if it means losing my job. I do not care. May I? I'm not disturbing you? Not at all. Come in. My husband just went out. Maybe you passed him? No, I wasn't so lucky. Have a seat. What would you like to drink? Bourbon, right? How do you know that I like bourbon? We drank some together on my wedding day. Ah, that's true. What a memory. That day your husband told me I was the reason that the two of you met. Hence why I've come to check on you. Thank you. Your husband was concerned. And it was me he confided in. In a friendly way. I didn't know. You were... depressed? Some more? Nervous breakdowns are more a matter for one's loved ones. Friends... Isn't that so? My husband has... taken great care of me. I'm sure he has. Some drugs are very effective, I believe. Perhaps. But... as you say, it's not the drugs that heal you. But the way they're given. And now you're fine? Indeed. If I don't look well, it's because I haven't done my make-up or hair. I'm ugly as sin. Many women would love to be your kind of ugly. I was very touched when your husband voiced his concerns to me. It was a sign of trust. I hope you, too, have a liking for me. Even if it's not completely true, I'd like to believe it. Let me help you. No, thanks. I don't need anyone to help me. I'm very happy. My husband and I, we... we're very united. Yes, very united. Very happy. Well, so much the better. I hope that lasts a lifetime. Alain. Shh. He got here last night. For how long? As long as he likes. He's at home here. Alain, I'll do anything for a coffee. In exchange for a coffee. Madam, is this Alain Revent's home? Yes. - Might you be Mrs Revent? - Yes. We are the extras for tonight's reception, madam. For tonight's... reception? Ah, yes! Yes, of course. Come in. Come in. It's through there. {\\an8}LENÔTRE CATERING - Mrs Revent? - Yes. Hello. Lenôtre Catering. Here are the goods you ordered. Come in. - Here, carry that, please. - Okay. Good evening, sir. Good evening, darling. We're entertaining? Of course. It's Dino's birthday. We've invited friends, charming people. But they're of no interest to you. You're very pale. You should go to bed. You need rest. Happy birthday. Care to dance? That's enough. You think you've made him jealous? I know what he likes. It might seem weird. But I'm sure it'd make him very happy if you and I... He likes making people suffer. But he likes to suffer, too. That's why he's left us alone. Since you love him... and I love him too... let's make him happy. You disgust me. Get the hell out. Has-been. No. No. No. Where is Dino? Gone. You mean he's gone out? No. I chucked him out. You did? Yes. And with pleasure. I want a divorce. A divorce? Alright. Alright. LAWYER OF THE PARIS BAR What's the matter? What are you looking for? Nothing. Then go to sleep. You'll need all your strength for the law courts. Where is... my medication? What medication? The stuff you gave me. The blue bottle. I don't know what you mean. My husband accepts the divorce. - Are you in agreement? - I never said that. Then am I lying? - Madam, please calm down. - Mr President. If I had, as she claims, agreed to the divorce, I wouldn't be here attempting to reconcile. Yes, that does sound fair. I love my wife dearly. He loves humiliating me. For example? He cheated on me. He wanted me to cheat on him. That doesn't make sense. You don't understand. What's more, he's never really been my husband. This is one of her obsessions. She's always saying she'll divorce me by invoking the non-consummation of marriage. Is that what you're invoking? - Yes. - With what proof? As for me, I can prove the marriage was consummated. My wife is with child. With child? But that's not true. It's not true. A medical exam will clarify that. But it's not true! He's lying. He's talking nonsense. He wants people to think I'm crazy. He's talking nonsense. DOCTOR'S SURGERY You are eight weeks' pregnant. Are you sure, doctor? No doubt about it, madam. Hello? I'd like to speak to Inspector Leroy. He's in a meeting and can't be disturbed. But it's urgent! I've already called three times! I'm telling you, I can't disturb him. As soon as he's finished, have him call me. Who's asking? Alain Revent. Alma 11-55. Very well, sir. Thank you. Hello? - Inspector Leroy here. - Good evening, Inspector! - Why are you calling? - My wife's gone missing. I'm very worried. You must find her. I'll alert all local police stations. Yes... Understood... - Please. - I'll call you. Thank you. He's looking for you. I'll keep nothing from you. Your husband was born in Zurich. I know. His mother fled Germany in 1942. After being abused. His mother fled Germany in 1942. After being abused. She sought refuge in Switzerland, where she had some possessions. She had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital. She had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital. And she's still there. That's where your husband was born. And she's still there. That's where your husband was born. Your husband is a dangerous man. It is imperative that you seek police protection. Your life is in danger. Your husband is a dangerous man. It is imperative that you seek police protection. Your life is in danger. My husband needs me. Hello? Hello. At last, it's you. Where are you? What does it matter? I must see you. You haven't hurt me enough. If I've hurt you, you must forgive me. There's something within me that makes me... I tried to resist, but... Nathalie! Yes? Nathalie, I know you love me. You must help me. Listen. I'm coming to get you. Give me the address. The hotel... I'm coming now. Wait for me. Mrs Revent. Mrs Revent? She paid her bill and left the hotel. She didn't leave a message? No. Who are you? Hello? Mr Alain Revent? Inspector Leroy. Good evening, Inspector. Come to Police HQ right away. What's going on? You knew she was pregnant! No. Yet that is what you proclaimed. I didn't want to lose her. Oh, you're... You hate me. Justice can do nothing against you. But as for me... I will prevent you from destroying your wife. Hello? I'm coming. Don't push. We waited for you. We touched nothing. Subtitle translation by: Lucy Harford\n"

Hanai, we're going to have a report prep session. Wanna come? Oh, sorry, I can't. I've got a kid waiting. - What? - Nice. - They're still babies. You're a father? Well, yeah. - Keep it up. - Keep it up. H-Hey... Excuse, excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me... Sota! - Did she gave birth? - She did. - Can I come and take a look later? - Sure. Yes! I'm home, Hanako. Yes, I'm home. Yeah, yeah. Where's Ayumi? Ayumi. Ayumi? How'd it go? You're all doing well. Good. I'm coming in. Shh. Ah, wait, wait... So cute.... They are trying their best to live. Yes. Rumi, too.

Why don't you just go yourself? Right? Because of them... Leave them to me. I had 10 cats at home. Right. Sorry. No, no. It's really great seeing puppies and kittens. Now, please go. - I'm counting on you! - Yeah! What's wrong? You want this? Here. I've got some more. Here, here... Here. Good, good, good... What are you doing here? What's wrong? It's okay. It's okay. Hey, hey. - So... you brought her home? - Yeah. Is that okay? Her life or surgical reports are more important. No, it's... Hey, you... I'm almost done. Okay, okay. Wait. There we go. There we go. Sota, you are by far the biggest dog freak I've ever met in my life. What, dog freak? I am respectfully referring to people who live for their dogs, as \"dog freaks\". Oh, and by the way, I'm a \"cat freak.\" You're a cat freak? I'm a dog freak? Probably the other freak. - Sota, I brought the materials! - Oh, thank you! - Huh? - That's great. What's wrong with that dog? See? A freak, right? That's so true. Huh? \"freak\"? She's got no expression. - Yeah. - There's scars all over her body. Where'd you come from? I'll have to call the animal shelter and the police. If it's a stray dog, we'll find her a new owner soon, don't worry. - Have you decided on a name yet? - Name? Let's see... Niko. Because you don't even smile. I see. It's Niko. I hope one day you can smile. Yes. You'll be alright. Want some? - The hell is this... - It's chips. They gave me a sample. This is a dog food. The spring rush of delivery left me with no money. - It's not so bad, you know. - I don't want it. I found Niko's owner! \"Surgery Laboratory.\" Tsk. So Niko is Amuro's dog - That means Niko is... - A dog for surgical practice. Maybe she was intended to be euthanized at the animal shelter... By practice, you mean they use live dogs, right? Yes, they cut open the belly of an innocent dog and take its life. - You'll understand in four years. - Sota! Careful of what you say. I know. It has contributed to the advancement of veterinary medicine. I know. But I'm not giving Niko back. We can't cause any more trouble for Professor Amuro. What if you can't be a vet? Can I help you? This. You found her? I'm Akita, fourth year veterinary student, and I'm helping Professor Amuro. - Where's Professor Amuro? - He's not here. No, but thank you for saving her. It was my fault she escaped. She escaped? I'll pick her up later. Thank you. Your address is... Ah... Thank you earlier. Come in. Keep your shoes on. Oh, so these are the dogs you guys say you're personally protecting. Yes. - Oh, Hanai, it's been a while. - Hello. I never thought I'd find her here with you. It's like the dog knows what it's doing. She thought, \"Oh, this person can help me.\" But it doesn't work like that. - This dog is... - I know, sir. Sota. Niko. You gotta go. Akita, help him. Yes. Excuse me, Mr. Hanai. Okay, come here. Hey, it's gonna be okay, okay? Come on... Come on. Good. Hanai, thank you for protecting her. Please excuse us. Niko... I'm sorry. Sota, what is it? Don't ask any questions. Just come to the apartment. Huh? What... No... - No one followed you here, right? - What? Never mind. Just get in here. Niko! Hello... Sota! Wait... you didn't steal her... No! I was on my way home after class, and Niko was there. She ran away again. She wanted to see me. So what are you gonna do? This time it's not looking good. What are you going to do? They're here. Is our dog in your care again? No. Sota. Don't. We have your dog. Oh, I see. May I? Excuse me. Sota. Niko. - Niko. - Niko. Let's go, Niko. - It's okay, it's okay. - Niko. Niko. Niko. Niko. Niko. Sota. Niko, good girl... Then I'll take her. No, wait, Akita. I'm giving this dog to Hanai. She's struggled to escape this far. I can't take away that vitality. We're studying veterinary medicine to save animals' lives. Life is good, isn't it? Well then, take care of her. This is a special case. Yes, thank you very much. You might just change the world of veterinarians. Bye. Akita, you're done for today. Ah, yes. Niko, you are saved! This is great, Sota. Excuse me, the collar... - No, not good at all! - What? Niko was saved, but it was a special case. I don't want one animal to die on my watch. Then what are you gonna do? I need help. I could save more if I had help. - Which is why I'm thinking of starting a club. - A club? How are you going to get people to come? They're already here. The name will be Dog Club! Let's make a dog club. \"Dog Club\", so you're not saving cats? We help everyone who's alive. Be it dogs or cats. Then I'd like to be in charge of cats in the Dog Club. - Okay, you're in. - Yay! Can I join you? These lab dogs, I wondered if I could do something for them. Sure. But you can't let the dogs escaped anymore. Start by taking the lab dogs for a walk. Yes, definitely! Good. Dog Club, huh? Nice, isn't it? Dog Club. Hanako! Hanako. Alright, Hanako is in the club too! Shut up! Hang in there! Ah! Hey! Hey... And so, the Dog Club was born, led by Sota Hanai, a fifth-year student at Towada Veterinary Medical School. [ Dog Club ] Our main mission is to rescue dogs and cats that have nowhere else to go and find new owners for them. Niko who was saved from surgery practice has found a new owner. Niko's survival gave me an insight into what the mission is all about. I was struggling with my university classes, and I barely had enough time and energy, but seeing the smiling faces of the cats and dogs gave me a sense of fulfillment that all my exhaustion vanished. All right, I'm taking it... - Hanako, Hanako... camera. - And the pose is... - Pose? - Let's do a pose. - What pose? - Bark! Bark! - Bark! Bark! - Look over there!

He got bit by another dog... A fight? The other guy look like a stray. It's pretty bad. He's gonna need a surgery. - Hospital? - That would be better. Uh, well, um... Don't worry about the money. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Okay, I'm going to trim the hair. Just hold it him in place. Okay. Doctor Sota, the stray cats are here. I've heard that you spay and neuter stray cats. I do. Thank goodness. A stray cat gave birth to kittens near my house, and it caused a lot of trouble. It's okay. How many of them did you bring? About ten of them. I went to the local hospitals, but they all refused me. - Right. It took me about two hours to drive here. Must have been hard. - We'll take care of them once we're done. - Thank you. - Let me help you. - Sorry. Thank you. - This way. - Yes. - Okay. - Let's begin. Okay. - It's a little too much white, isn't it? - Yeah. Ushi? Ushi-chan. Doctor, you must be hungry. I don't think so. - Can I get you something? - No, I'm good. - She's the last one. - That was quicker than I thought. Call that volunteer from earlier. Did you take on these cats for free again by any chance? Yes, I did. I can't say no to someone who drove two hours by herself to get here. I know that, of course. Most that are killed at the Animal Shelter Center are kittens. That's why it's so important to spay and neuter strays so that they won't multiply anymore. I know there are volunteers who do this for free. So? You take on too much work by yourself, Doctor. - Somebody's got to do it. - Even if you say it. What will you do if you collapse? I wasn't complimenting you. Hanako. I'm getting pissed off. Papa... Please train the juniors. And take a break and have a proper meal. I do. That's my food. I'm sorry. No way. An emergency? It's okay. Let's take it. You stay right there, Doctor. Stay. Hanako. Hanako. What can I do for you? Excuse me... Is Mr. Sota Hanai here? He's here.. - Is this an emergency? - Ah, no... Come in. Thank you very much. Doctor. In here. [ Pet Shop Dream ] Mr. Kume! Hey. - Hello. - Hello. - This is the veterinarian, Doctor Hanai. - Nice to meet you. Hello. - Thank you. - Please take care. Let's go, Natsu. My François scratches his ears a lot. - He's itching. - I see. Okay, let me see your ears. It's Malassezia. Malassezia. It's gonna be okay. Okay. Excuse me. Okay... Director, Ms. Komori brought us something. That lady always brings us good food. Yes. Director, a kid here says he found kittens. - No, no. He needs to leave. - B-But... I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do here. Maybe you could talk to your mother or father again. I can't keep them at home. No, they said. Kid, maybe you should take them to the Animal Shelter Center. If I take them to the center, they'll just kill them. No, these days, they don't all get put down. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll find its owner. Thank you very much. Are you okay? I'm sorry. Dad! I mean... Director. How about we keep them and find their owners? No, we can't. I've told you before, don't get involved in animal protection. But... And now for the news. Yesterday evening in Towada City, Aomori Prefecture, veterinarian Sota Hanai, 38, from Tokyo, was arrested on suspicion of home invasion, damage to property, and theft. According to the Towada Central Police, Hanai is suspected of sneaking into this pet store, Dream, and stealing 30 popular dog breeds worth approximately 2 million yen. No, it was a terrible experience. It's like he forced his way in. The suspect Hanai, works as a veterinarian and is also involved in animal protection activities... Ms. Yoshimi. Ah... Tahara, what is it? It seems that a graduate from our university was arrested. Oh, really? They said he's the one who created the Dog Club. - As I recall, you used to be in the dog cl-- - What!? Did you just say \"Dog Club\"? Yes. Hanai, you're free to go. - Doctor Sota! - I'm sorry for troubling you, Satoko. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm sorry. Anyway, how are those dogs? A shelter over here is taking care of them, right? I'm not allowed to give that information to a suspect. No, Mr. Tanahashi. They're all in need of treatment. Have you been to the store? Some are dead, the sanitation is terrible, and there isn't enough food. As far as the police are concerned, there's no problem. That's crazy, isn't it? The Act on Welfare and Management of Animals states that if you don't keep them in a proper environment, it's abuse... Hanai, I understand how you feel but... you were arrested for theft. - I don't care about that. The dogs are... Doctor Sota, let's go home. If you make a scene, you'll end up back in jail. Mr. Tanahashi, please do something. I'm sorry. It's not my jurisdiction. - Sota! - What the hell's going on? There's no money, no food, there's nothing I can do. I'll take them all. You're taking it for free? The center won't even take them in nowadays. There's a company that'll take them. It's too expensive. This. This. I can't afford this shit. [ Pets you can no longer keep, we'll take them! ] You don't run the store anymore, do you? Back in the day, when puppies were born, they would sell like hotcakes. I guess their boom is over. They say cats are more profitable now. I'll have them all spayed and neutered so they won't give birth anymore, if that's fine. - Sure, if you'll take them. - Okay. Then it's not your fault at all, Mr. Sota. Did you sign any contract? No. It was too sudden. I told you so, didn't I? You take on so much work. What kind of contract is that before life? This is just like back at the Dog Club! - That's right. - What? Back when we were in school, he had a run-in with the police. They said they couldn't take care of them anymore, so Sota asked if they could take them in, and he... took ten, remember? Later, the owner's grandmother came and said, \"they've been stolen!\" We got a report here. At that time, Shibasaki stepped in between, so we were able to manage. Let's not talk about that. Speaking of Mr. Shibasaki, why isn't he here? I don't know. - You want me to call him? - No! You don't have to. Satoko, can you head back first? What? I have somewhere to go. No. - I can't leave those dogs alone. - No! I have to go. Okay. I'll take care of the hospital while you're gone. Take this instead. Please read it carefully. - \"List of things not to do.\" - That's right. \"Don't take on everything on your own. Don't push yourself, no dog chips.\" The hell is this? If you don't, I'll... quit. - Are you serious? - I am! Then, members of the Dog Club, please take care of Doctor Sota. Okay, let's go. Hello! Oikawa, I've just given him an IV. Look after him. - I'm sorry. - Hey! - I've been waiting for you! - Mrs. Nakagoshi. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. It is. - It's been a while. I'm Akita. - Do you remember me? I'm Yoshimi. Ah! Dog Club! Wow, you guys are all here. No, no, that's not important. We've got a problem. That old man Kume brought the police and took all the dogs away. - What? He owns them, so I can't do anything. Mrs. Nakagoshi, you saw those dogs, right? It's horrible. So why did you give them back? I understand that, but there's nothing I can do if he brought the police here! That's right. He owns them. Why does he have ownership of their lives? That's even weirder. - A dog is a dog! - Sota, please calm down. I can't calm down! Who knows what's gonna happen to the dogs as we speak? I'm so sorry. Um... Mika Kawase, she's been worried sick waiting for you. I was the one who took Mr. Sota to Mr. Kume. No need to apologize. All right, let's all go get those dogs back. Sota, that's a bad idea. We're not students anymore. Why are you talking like a boring adult? No, no. We're all adults here. Our mission as veterinarians is to save lives. Don't be stupid. \"Stupid\"... Mr. Akita was worried about you, so he came all this way from Tokyo. - I didn't ask him to. - Huh? You don't have to say that. If you're going to fight, why not do it outside? Wait, what happened to Shibasaki? He stayed here, right? - Don't worry about him. - Okay. Well, anyway. If you're going to leave them with me, make sure you take ownership of them first. That's all I'll say. Okay? Oh, right. - You're good with cats, right? - What? Take a look at something, will you? Ah, okay. It's my fault... I'm really sorry. You want to save those dogs, right? Yes. Then it's okay. - I'll take it from here. - No, but... Don't worry. Who do you think you're talking to here? Mr. Kume! Are you there? Mr. Kume! - What the hell? - How are the dogs? - If you want it back, you should have told me. - Shut up. Please don't get rid of them. I'll take care of them, I promise. It's none of your business. I'm not mad at you at all, Mr. Kume! Leave or I'll call the police! Mr. Kume... Mr. Kume! Let's talk one more time! Hey! Mr. Kume! Mr. Kume! Take... Take this! What's wrong? [ Dog Thief Unforgivable! ] [ Give the animals back to nature! ] The hell is that? Don't worry about it. I'll keep it. Anyway, come inside. [ Horrible, unbelievable ] [ Crazy vet hospital ] [ Too scary ] [ The doctor who saved my dog. What a crime... ] Should we... close for the day? Shall we... Hanako... Can't our hospital start some kind of protection activity? We could take in dogs that have nowhere else to go, or stray cats. No need to do that. Protection isn't something a vet should be doing. Wasn't it your senior who was arrested the other day? No, that's... It's dangerous to keep a dog that you don't even know where it came from. Stray cats are also at high risk. What if they're infected? It's going to cause trouble for all the other patients. Not until you have your own hospital. But I wondered if there was a point to it... What? That was a huge statement. You see, I was in charge of cats in the Dog Club. Okay. One day we found a stray cat with a huge belly. I thought, \"Oh, she's pregnant.\" But it was just water in her stomach. That's the last stage of FIP, right? Yes. And... the other cats got FIP too. We ended up letting ten of them die. That must have been hard. That's why I can't let... that happen again to the cats. I've decided that I'm going to take down the FIP. That's so cool. But there's no effective vaccine. There's no cure. I don't even know if it's contagious. Almost 10 years have passed with nothing to show for it. Hanako... What do you think I should do? [ Spring, 2000 ] [ Towada Animal Shelter Animal Control Center ] These are the dogs that came in today. They were captured or brought in by their owners. The next room is room 2. These are the dogs that came in yesterday. This is how we move them from one day to the next. And the last one? If we can't find an owner, then we... put them down. Is it by gas? Yes. How horrible. Yes. I'm sorry, but this is the end of the tour. - I'll take all these dogs. - Huh? If I take care of all of them, you won't have to kill them, right? I'm sorry... We don't give away full-grown dogs. I don't know who you are, so I don't want you to get in trouble. I'm a student at a veterinary college in Towada, so I'm okay with being bitten. That's the rule. Right now, the only dogs we can give away are puppies. - Why only puppies? - It's the rule. I'm sorry. Oh, and what about you? I'd like to adopt a puppy, too. Okay. Right this way, please. Do you two have any preferences? - Any puppy will do. - Any puppy will do. No... No way... Actually, I'm also a student at Towada Veterinary Medical School. So I can deal with any dog. What, the same school? What year? - I'm Ryosuke Shibasaki, a second-year student. - So we're classmates. Then Shibasaki, you can choose first. I'll take care of the rest of the puppies. No, there are other people who want puppies, so you can't take them all. Then give the last dog to me... and the second from the last to Shibasaki. Huh? Oh, that's fine. Okay. This is Hanako, and Shibasaki's dog is Taro. Yeah. Nice to meet you, Hanako. I guess I named them both. You're so cute, Hanako. So... Hanai, why did you choose veterinary medicine? I've loved dogs since I was a kid, and I thought it would be great to be a vet. What about you? I... want to stop the killing. What? You have to be a veterinarian to be the director of the animal shelter, right? My plan is to get into the animal shelter and stop the killing. You're going all that way to where they're putting them out? But I think there's hope. I have a big dream to change the worst place. Shibasaki. You're hell of a lot better than I thought you were. What? Let's be friends starting today. Let's do what we can to help those unfortunate dogs and cats. Yeah. All right, it's settled. Are you getting tired now, Taro? - He's been gaining weight lately... - He's getting fat? He eats a lot. You write... Come on, say hello. That feels good, doesn't it? Okay, here we go. Okay. Okay. Sota, are you serious? Huh? You said you're boycotting surgery practice. That's right. I won't do that. You can't become a vet without surgery practice. Using a live dog as a teaching material is insane, right? Even if it was a dog that was supposed to be killed, I won't do it. Let me tell you again, if you don't do the practical, you won't be able to take the state exam. I know that. You said you wanted to be a vet and save lives. That's the hurdle you have to overcome to get there. No! I won't do it. I'll do it. I'll do it and be a vet. I'll never forget how I got my hands dirty. Have you ever heard of the phrase \"one kill to save many lives\"? One kill to save many lives? Originally, it was a Buddhist phrase which means that by killing one person, you save many. In surgery practice, it's true that one life is sacrificed. But... through that practice, we learn about life, we become veterinarians, and we can save many lives. Can you think of it like that? For example, how about gaining experience by attending surgeries at a local veterinary clinic? In fact, it's what most Western veterinary colleges do. I don't know if any veterinarian would be willing to help with that. I'll look for them. I'll get as many cases as I can and submit them in a report. Okay. Well, let's look at those reports and see what we can find. Thank you very much. - Report? - Yes. - Good luck with that. - Thanks. Good work. We can't treat diseases, huh? I need to examine an animal. Information and knowledge. Knowledge. I can save them all. Then you may begin. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. I'll make the incision. Stop the bleeding, please. It's over. Hanako. Hanako. Hanako, it's over. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You've been watching me. Thank you. Yes. I respect what you're trying to do, but you shouldn't think you can change the world all by yourself. I believe I can save them all. I'm going to do it alone. Thank you very much. Mr. Kume, it's Hanai! Don't just come in here without permission. I'll call the police. Now, now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I just brought the food today. All right, come on. Eat. I'll use your water. Here, have some water. Good. Hey! I'm going home in a minute. - Here's some sweet bean buns for you. - I don't want it. It's really good. I'll... I'll leave it here. Here you go. I brought you some food. Mr. Kume! [ Naoyuki Kume Tetsuko ] Anyone home? Mr. Kume! Mr. Kume! It's Hanai. - What, you again? - I've brought the food. I've got some snacks. Can I leave it here, then? You want some? - Elsa won't like it. - No, it's just a snack. She's an experienced mother. This one here is the first dog. Elsa? I see. You did good. Have a good rest. You're gonna be okay. Hmm? You're gonna be okay. You like it? She was my wife's dog. She loved dogs. So... I want to have this little thing for her... We built the pet store because she said she wanted to do it. So we borrowed money to build the store and we worked hard together. Elsa's retired now. I don't care anymore. The neighbors say the place stinks and it's too noisy, and the girl promised she'd help me. Ms. Kawase? She used to come to my store all the time to look at the dogs. Why did you call the police? I missed the dog when you took them away. So that's why... Because Elsa was my wife's dog. I was afraid my wife would get mad if I gave her to you. If I hadn't done that, you never would've given her back. You should've told me. Okay, good. Doctor, Mr. Hanai's on the phone. Ah.. Thanks. - Hello? Akita speaking. - Oh, Akita. It's the dogs from that pet store in Towada, and if they let me have it, I'll operate on it, but I need your help. What? Where is it? I'm thinking of doing it in Towada. Um... what about the ownership issue? I'll take care of it. I'm sorry. I can't take a day off from our hospital, and on my days off, I'm with my family. Is that so? I understand. [ Mr. Sota ] Over here. Over here. Ah... They're so cute... Come here. I just had to show it to you, Ms. Yoshimi. Wow, you're so cute... Hey, what are we gonna do with them? Don't worry. I've decided to keep them all. All of it? I've got my mother, my grandmother, a dog and a cat, so I can handle a little extra. It's not that simple, you know. What... what do you mean? I'm sorry. I told you before, I've had a lot of cats die on me. That's when I knew I'm not qualified to have a cat anymore. That's why I'm bothered when people simply say they want to \"keep\" them. Does one need a qualification to own a cat or a dog? Well, I thought... if they have nowhere else to go, then I'll take them. It's that simple. Yeah. Maybe I'm just wrong about a lot of things. There are many ways to deal with animals. There are no \"right\" answers, remember? Now, let's get on and make that vaccine, shall we? Oh, that? Yeah, right. Yes? Is now a good time? Nana said she had a favor to ask. - Daddy. - What is it? For my next birthday present, I want a shelter cat. A shelter cat? You are a vet. I bet you save a lot of lives. Nana wants to help, too. That's why I want to adopt a shelter cat. John, John, over here. John, house, house. Good for you. See you tomorrow. - All right, we're done here. - Yes. I'll be fine on my own. See you tomorrow, Taro. Mr. Shibasaki, you don't look well. Do you have a cold? - No, I'm fine. - You... - Your nose is dry. - My nose is usually dry. He's not a dog. - Yoshimi, yours is dry too... - No, don't... - You good? - Go home. Go home. - I'll be here in the morning. - Good work. - Good work. - Good work. Bye-bye, Taro. Hanako. It's gonna be cold night, huh? Huh? Shibasaki? Shibasaki. Shibasaki. Taro? Taro. Shibasaki! Hey, Shibasaki! Shibasaki! What are you doing? Shibasaki! Shibasaki! Hey! Shibasaki. You're burning up, Shibasaki! You're Ryosuke Shibasaki. Can you understand me? Yes. He looks pale. But why is he out here? There's kerosene and stuff here, so I guess he came to get it. - It's a miracle. - What? The temperature was below zero and he was out here all night. It's a miracle, that's all I can say. - Hey... - Excuse me. What is it, Mr. Shibasaki? The dogs... they haven't eaten anything since yesterday, so please feed them. What? The dogs, feed them. - Feed? - I got it. Don't worry about it. Shibasaki, if you die, the dogs will die too. I'm sorry, Sota. The dogs. I couldn't protect them... Idiot. The dog protected you. Commence transport. Hurry, hurry... Congratulations! Thanks. Thanks. You both are officially veterinarians. Well, we'll see about that. There they are... Taro. Taro. Taro. - Hanako. - Taro. Taro. Shibasaki! Do you want to run a veterinary clinic with me someday? I'll train for a few years, and then I'll open a hospital that also does animal rescue. We've been over this before. The answer is no. Are you seriously going to work at the center? Yes. - You're gonna have to put them down. - I know that. You don't have to do this. - Come with me-- - Because someone has to do it. so I will do it. With my own hands, I'm gonna stop them. You have your ways of doing things, Sota. We may do things differently, but aren't we aiming for the same thing? I don't think it's the same. I don't want to kill a single one of them. - I don't want to kill either. - If so... I'm sorry, Sota. [ Towada City Animal Control Center ] He quit? Is Ryosuke Shibasaki not here? Yes. Why did he quit? When did he quit? - That's private information, so... - I'm Shibasaki's best friend. - It's no problem at all. - No, it's not that... I also got a dog here named Hanako. - She's doing great. - I see. No, but it's... And this Shibasaki has one named Taro... Excuse me... What a nice environment you got here. It was Mr. Shibasaki's idea to use it like this. Since Mr. Shibasaki came here, this center has changed. We used to be in one of the top ten rates of animal euthanasia, but now it's down to 30%. Come in. This is where we spay and neuter all the dogs and cats in our care. Mr. Shibasaki himself was performing the surgery. Why did Shibasaki quit? Animal euthanasia... has decreased, but we still do put down animals. Old dogs, sick dogs and kittens are still subject for putting down. On the day they are put down, Mr. Shibasaki walked with them, fed them their favorite foods, and then gave each one a shot in their arms to put them to sleep before sending them off. I think maybe he just couldn't take it anymore. I don't think I can manage to kill one. Mr. Hanai, you didn't do surgery practice, did you? Shibasaki told you that? Mr. Shibasaki often talked about you a lot. We don't have to do that ridiculous surgery practice. You're really strong, Mr. Hanai. What? Mr. Shibasaki wasn't as strong as you. Mr. Shibasaki tried to inject himself with a lethal drug. Mr. Shibasaki, w--what are you doing? Wait, st-- Hey, st-- Don't do it! Don't... - I'm gonna go with them. - Hey... I'm gonna go with them. Get a grip on yourself! Please stop! Why... Why... Why do they keep sending dogs and cats here even after we save them? Why? Why do we have to kill those who are still alive? They... They haven't done anything wrong. Humans, we multiply on our own, we take lives, and I've had enough. No... Even so... Wait! Mr. Shibasaki! After that, he quit the center, and now I can't reach him. [ Shibasaki ] Oh, my. Sota. Wow, it's been a while. It's been a while since we last met. Sota, you came all this way... - Thank you. But Ryosuke's away on business right now. Is he all right? Yeah, he's fine. He's a salesman for a pharmaceutical company. He travels here and there. If so, then it's fine. Yes. This cat is one that I took in. I see. Hey. Then, um... when Ryosuke comes home, please give him this. It's my contact info. I run a small veterinary hospital in Tokyo. Okay. I'll give this to him. Let's do our best today... - Hello. - Ah, Sota, you're here. Mrs. Nakagoshi. Thanks. - Get everything ready. - Yes. Mr. Kume, I'm glad you've made a decision. - They're doing it for free, right? - Of course. Then it's okay. Sota, I'm counting on you today. Yes. I'm sorry about all this. What are you talking about? We'll just have to do what we always do. Right. Here they come. What you have is your friend. Why are you here? Mr. Sota, if I leave you to it alone, Satoko will get mad at me. We're vets, too. What about your family? It's okay. - Did you get divorced? - No, I didn't! - What the hell are you saying? - It's over there. Hello. Ah, let's do it! Good girl. Thank you very much for your hard work. - Good work. - Good work today. - It was exhausting, wasn't it? - Well done! Yeah. Thanks for the help. If you hadn't been here, I would've been up till morning. That's right. Good work. So... what are we going to do with those dogs? - I'm thinking of holding an adoption fair. - What? That's what Mr. Kume says he wants. Hey, Sota, are you sure that's okay? - You're gonna get tricked-- - I don't care if I got tricked. I want to save them. So, will you please help me one more time? Let's hold an adoption fair like we used to, and find new owners for them. I guess we don't really have a choice. Well, if that's the case, then eat some corn first, you idiots. - Let's dig in! - Let's dig in! Good. Doctor Sota, good morning. Good morning. - What did you do this time? - What? A lot of things came in here. - Oh, apple juice. - It's some kind of sauce. - Oh, it's Gen Tare. - What? Is it popular? - Yeah, it's from Aomori... - What about this one? Garlic, tomatoes, cucumbers... Oh, wait. A letter... Aomori... Who is it from? Oh, look, \"Dear Doctor Sota...\" \"I found out about the pet store, Dream, on Instagram.\" \"For the dogs of Towada, thank you very much...\" - Instagram? - Instagram? Let's take a look. Ms. Kawase was the one who posted about it. There's also one from that junior member of the Dog Club. Oh... Pakuchi. How nostalgic. We're from Dog Club. We're holding an adoption fair. Please check it out. - How about it? - The Dog Club is holding an adoption fair! We're doing an adoption fair! - Hello! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Um... my daughter wants a dog. What kind of dog do you want? Any dog will do. Any dog will do. That's rude. I'm sorry. Me and this one here, when we went to get our dog, we said, \"Any dog will do.\" And then... I met Taro here. And... this is my dog, Hanako. Now she's my best friend. Wanna touch her? So cute. You want to see the other dogs? Yes. - Shibasaki, please. - Yeah. Okay, let's go. There's a lot of them, huh? Actually, my daughter doesn't go to school. I thought if she got a dog, they might become friends. If that's the case, I'm sure he'll find the right dog for her. Which one of these dogs is the least popular? Huh? Why do you ask? Come on, just tell me. Puppies are really popular. They're cute, right? But old dogs can be... really, really cute. He's a regular at adoption fairs, and it's hard for him to find a mate. It's a male. What's his name? His name is Rokuro. I'll take Rokuro. I see. But why? Because he's like me. Like you? I don't have any friends, and no one likes me at all. Same as Rokuro. No? Not at all. I'm sure Rokuro will be your best friend. Isn't that right, Rokuro? - You're not scared? - Yes. You were Rokuro's owner, weren't you? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. So... how's Rokuro? Six years ago... I was 15. I see. He did good. Rokuro was really smart. He learned to sit up and shake. And then I wanted to show him to everyone. Next thing I knew, I was going to school. And then after that we were together all the time. But... Huh? Once I got into high school, I enjoyed club activities and hanging out with my friends. - Mika, your lunch! - Oh, no. - Don't forget it. - Thanks. - You be careful. - Yes... I... in Rokuro's final moments, I was not there with him. While I was at summer camp, he... Rokuro. Rokuro! I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry. I didn't even... get to say goodbye to Rokuro. I wanted to get a dog again, but... I felt bad for Rokuro. I think Rokuro understood that. If I ever get a dog again, it'll be from the Dog Club... I wanted to get a dog from you and Mr. Shibasaki. That's when Mr. Kume from Dream asked me for advice. So it was like that. I didn't mean to drag you into this. I'm sorry. - No, you didn't. Thank you for telling me. Mr. Shibasaki, how is he? I'm here again. Sota, I'm sorry. I think Ryosuke caught a cold. Hanako! Long time no see. Wow, good girl. - Good girl, good girl. - She remembers you. - Is he in his room? - Yes, he is, but... - Can I talk to him for a sec? - No. - You might catch it... No, no - No, that's okay. - I just want to see him. - Wait... No... Shibasaki! It's me! Shibasaki! Shibasaki! [ Let's do the Dog Club again! ] Shibasaki! Hanako. Hanako. How are you, Hanako? Where's Taro? He passed away three years ago. I see. Shibasaki. Take a look at this. Rokuro? - This girl is... Mi... Mika, right? - Yeah. Now she's a college student in Tokyo. Well, I got arrested. - I saw it on TV. - It was crazy. I'm not talking about that. I've been getting a lot of stuff. Look. They're all smiling, right? Dogs, cats, and people. And there's letters too. This is what we do. That's what the Dog Club has done. They're so adorable. Right? What's this? - \"List of things not to do.\" - Give me that. \"Don't take on everything on your own. Don't push yourself.\" \"No dog chips.\" No, you're still eating dog chips-- No, I don't. Sometimes. Sometimes I eat them. It's not that... You know, I've been thinking about things, too. That's why both Taro... and I... were so happy to have met you. Sota. What the hell are you saying? No, this is not the time to be laughing. Yeah. - Over here. Over here... - Yes. Oh, we work in the same lab. Tahara Yusaku. - I'm Tahara. Nice to meet you. - I'm Hanai. Nice to meet you. - This is Mr. Sota. - Mr. Sota. What is it? What? He's so young. Nice. I'll be damned. Okay, good... Well, yesterday's news said today would be around 38 degrees. - What!? - It will be. - Is it really that bad? - Yes. I wonder if we'll get any customers. Mr. Sota. Mr. Shibasaki. Huh? Mr. Shibasaki! - How many in total? - Thirty today, I think. There are many more in the back, so please take a look. - Thank you. - Yes. Yeah, hold the hip. Like that. Like that. Aren't they cute? That's Keema. Keema. This one had multiple deliveries. That's a lot... I hope she can relax now. I'm sure we'll find her a good owner. They're more interested in seeing Elsa. Go ahead. Wow... As I thought, she's cute. - Can we touch her? - It's a little hard to touch her right now. She's been through a lot and is scared of people. Oh, I see. Even though she looks so cute. She appears to be quite an old lady. But if you're patient with her, I'm sure you'll get along. We strongly believe that. I'm sorry. We've never owned a dog before. I think that's a bit much. Yeah... Maybe a younger one. - We understand. We won't force you. - I'm sorry. If you'd like, you can take a look over here, too. Ah, they're so cute. There's no way Elsa's gonna find someone to take her. Mr. Kume. So why are you doing this? You don't even get paid. Mr. Kume, Sota and the others aren't like that. Mr. Kume. We're veterinarians... we live for the animals. It's normal for us animal professionals to do this kind of thing. The local veterinarian should've helped Mr. Kume's store before it went under. I think the government should be held responsible. I used to work at an animal shelter center in Towada until two years ago, and we're the ones who should be dealing with this. I'm so sorry. We... became veterinarians to save animals' lives. And we won't give up on Elsa. We'll make her happy. They are all good dogs! It's all right. I'm sorry everyone. Take care of Elsa for me. We will. Ms. Okada, I'm sorry. Thank you. I'll take that. - Gather around, everyone! - Yes. - Thank you for your hard work today. - Good work. Thanks to all of you, we've found 14 new adopters. What about the rest? I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it. Excuse me! I'd like to adopt one. Really? That's great. Okay. Which one? Elsa. Elsa, huh? - It's a lot of work. - I know. But... I would like to be an owner. I understand how you feel, but you don't have to push yourself. Is there anyone you can take care of her with? Yes. I live with my cousin in Tokyo, and it's a pet-friendly apartment. Why do you want Elsa? I... couldn't look after Rokuro. So it was like that. That's why I want to face them this time. I want to give her time to relax and be happy. All right, let's try it out. But before that, I want to hang with her for a while. Thank you very much. When I get back to Tokyo, I'll take Elsa to the hospital and will try to get her to open up a little. It's okay. She's a dog who trusted someone once. Take it slow. Yes. Thank you. I'm glad I came. Thank you. - Okay, I'm gonna go. - Oh. Shibasaki. What? What are you going to do now? I'm thinking of going back to the center. I see. What? You're not gonna stop me? If I stop you, will you stop? I won't stop. Right? We may do things differently, but our goals are the same. That's right. I'm gonna try again. Yeah. But first, I'll make a world where not a single dog goes to the center. Well, you'll see. Okay. - See you around. - Oh. See you around. - Ah, this is pyoderma. - Pyoderma... Let's give him some medicine. It happens a lot when it's humid. Is that so? - Do you have an insurance card? - Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. You'll be paying 30%. Okay. Take care. Ah...You made a mess in your toilet again. Elsa. Elsa, let's hang in there. Oh, here it is. Here it is. She's full of energy. - Here, here. - Over here. Oh!

The act of paying out dogs from shelters for veterinary education has been prohibited since 2005. Also, the \"surgery practice\" that uses living animals featured in the film was discontinued in 2018 at the university where it was modeled. The shooting was done safely under the guidance of an animal trainer and veterinarian. No harm was done to the animals, and we tried to make them as comfortable as possible. ♪ It's nice to meet you, those eyes, ♪ they sink into the depths of my heart ♪ Even loneliness and melancholy ♪ are wrapped in kindness ♪ Under the cold winter night, ♪ you saved me from freezing with just your body ♪ Even if I'm unreliable or clumsy, ♪ I swear to protect you with these hands ♪ I wanna know you ♪ but I don't think I can stay here for long ♪ In the face of inevitable reality, ♪ there are some things you just can't shake ♪ I wanna hold you, ♪ even if the winds are strong, I won't change, ♪ I'll protect this love ♪ with all my might ♪ I'll never let go of your hand again ♪ so that no more tears will fall ♪ I know what's right and I know the answer, ♪ but I want to believe that miracles do happen ♪ An unforgiving future cruelly announced, ♪ the unnoticed cry of life ♪ My whole body is screaming to reach out to you, ♪ and so with my bare resolve in my heart, ♪ I'll face it ♪ We were so absorbed in each other's company, ♪ we poured out everything we had in our youth ♪ Let's get together under a single thought ♪ and create the revolution of a lifetime ♪ I wanna live with you ♪ No matter how much it hurts, you're not gonna give up, are you? ♪ You can't lie to yourself, can you? ♪ I wanna laugh with you Even if we part ways, it will be all right ♪ Because we both are aiming for the same thing ♪ I'm not going to run away from this absurd world ♪ Looking away is much harder ♪ Believing that hope can be lit in the midst of despair ♪ Even if there's no end in sight, we'll keep fighting together ♪ At times, I was pointed at and ridiculed ♪ There were days when I sighed with sadness ♪ But still, my love overflows and fills up, ♪ so I struggle with all my heart, so that I can be there for you ♪ I'll never let go of your hand again ♪ so that no more tears will fall ♪ I know what's right and I know the answer, ♪ but I want to believe that miracles do happen ♪ An unforgiving future cruelly announced, ♪ the unnoticed cry of life ♪ My whole body is screaming to reach out to you, ♪ and so with my bare resolve in my heart, ♪ we'll live together {\\an8}[ Inubu! ] [ English subtitle brought to you by ECOTV ] [ QC: rjgman56 ]\n"

Someone might hear you. You're the only one left who still calls me that. {\\an8}Like me, we can feel the death pangs of the industry that I gave life to. {\\an8}I sacrificed my own life, {\\an8}I didn't get to have my own family. {\\an8}I wasn't blessed with a beautiful wife. But like you, I had plenty of children. {\\an8}But among all of them, you are… {\\an8}your favorite? {\\an8}Yes, my most favoured. {\\an8}Beautiful, strong, intelligent. Even if you're a pain in the ass. You can stop taking on sexy roles. In the midst of your fame, you will study hard. And not only study... you will make it your life's work. You will not only breathe life back into the sex industry of the Philippines give it a new look, a new life. Consider it a fair exchange for the life I blessed you with. You will have everything you need. I have arranged everything with my people. Do not fail me. Promise me this. I promise, father. Father? Father? Father is dead… Ma'am, would you like a BJ? I don't want Buko Juice, I prefer Coke. A feel for luck. Oh, god! Hey, my dears. Could you lend me a hand? Just push my car. - Okay, ma'am. - Thank you. Alma Cares… Hmm… impressive! You see this all the time in K-Dramas. People showing off their wealth. You know what, I'm not the brightest at Math but I think it's just the three of us here. That's right. So I guess, we are still waiting for someone? Actually, I have been waiting for you. Enough, ladies. This is a sacred place. Have you heard of her? Her name is Linda Lovelace. An American pornstar who starred in a movie called Deep Throat. She played a bit part in one of father's films in the 70s. Yes, I know her! She's the one with a vagina in her throat so she loves to… …that's what she loves. Excuse me. It's not a \"vagina\". \"Clitoris.\" She has a clitoris down her throat that's why she needs to perform a deep throat to achieve orgasm. Where can you find the clitoris? In the vagina, right? Hey, easy! I feel like my clitoris moved to my butt. Did it move back? That's enough, ladies. We need to go to the orientation room real quick. We have a long list in our agenda. Some kind of a librarian? Well, this is the library of most controversial files. Okay. You keep pulling a fast one. Alma Cares… Well, I'm sure you have an idea why I summoned you here. What's this about? Are we making a movie? For Netflix? A reality show? How about an orgy, game? Well, actually… It's a combination of what you've said, and more. More than 50 years ago, a vision was born. A man and his vision. Papang founded Molo films with his sweat, tears, and blood. And of course, his seed. She said seed. Nasty! The Bomba Films industry was on fire. Pene movies movies was dominating the box office. After the Marcos years were over, the porn industry took on a new face and became more conservation. Because people's urges were repressed, even softcore porn garnered audiences in the 80's. In the 90s, in the twenty-first century. But as they say, nothing lasts forever. On the onset of the internet and social media, the industry of titiilating porn films saw its demise. As time passed, the public sought out new tastes. They also became more impatient. Porn videos killed the industry of porn movies. As they said in the movie \"Boogie Nights\", bold movies have turned solely for masturbatory purposes. Who cares about about stories, about plots, about narratives? The more staged it is, the more boring it is. The more raw the scenes seem like, the more exciting they are. Which explains why people stick to sex scandals like flies to shit. In Father's death bed, he told me that even if it drains all his wealth, nothing could revive him. Nothing. But he was sure about one thing... and that is his vision, that once saw its death, could ultimately be revived. If the taste of the public has changed, we will introduce a new formula. After careful deliberation of the company stakeholders, we came up with a simple plan. You are here because we badly need your expertise. Huh? What do you expect to gain from us has-beens? Excuse me, don't group me in that sad corner. I still have plenty of followers on every social media platform. But wait, expertise in what, exactly? As for me, all I can offer is public service. But no extra service. Alma Cares. Please take your seat, ladies. Well, you won't be playing any roles on camera. You will all be working behind the scenes. You will help grow a promising star. The next Philippine Pornstar. We will create the public's ultimate fantasy. All of you have had your individual experiences in acting, your own realities, your own scandals, your own flavors your own love potions. You mean contusions. Is this some master class for getting naked? For moaning seductively? Yeah, is it for getting the right facial expressions? Why don't you just make her marathon sex scandals? What do you need workshops for? Well, nothing beats real life application. Undressing isn't the only thing you will be teaching. Undressing one's mask. Undressing one's identity. Actually, pornography is a deeply conservative genre. Whoa, really? Conservative? Well, not everything is revealed in porn. There are no plots. It's always down to fucking. On the couch, in the kitchen, cumshot, close-up… What do they censor? The story. The pleasure is in the story. That's why people are crazy about scandals. Because they know it's real. The people in it are real. It's a real story. We're just taking a peek. And that's what we want to achieve here. We will make Bomba films that has the feel of a scandal. That's what you're here for. Because we know we can rely on you, in your own unique little ways. Am I right, Ligaya? You have mastered the craft of bringing our the joy in your viewers. Just how many times did you fake your orgasm just to satisfy your man? Just to get what you want? Because isn't it all just a game? Even the most intimate things in life are but commodities. Just objects. And we trade those commodities. We trade power for power. Sex is power. Money is power. Sex for money is but an exchange for power. But we have to control that power. Because it can explode in our palms like a bomb. Wow, very impressive. Looks like someone did their research well. Why don't we just have a round of drinks? I agree. I'll take care of that once we're done here. As you all know, I have a Masters Degree in Psychology. I invested a lot of time working with other experts in the field. Vladimir Honra. Known for being a pop culture historian and porn critic. Have you heard of him? Yago Tapado, award-winning writer. The man behind... Revenge of the Vagina! The Curse of the Virgin Breasts! I love that! They shot it in Bataan! He also directed A Vertical Cut Closes with Open Legs! That's my favorite! Lolito Ramada. No introductions needed. They will provide the theories, the gossip. The nitty and the gritty of the industry. They'll handle the theory part. You'll handle the practice. You will have your handouts tomorrow. I will have dinner sent to your quarters so you can get some rest. Phew! I'm so glad to hear that. I'm spent. The travel was tiring. So exhausted, fuck. {\\an3}As you all know, this invitation comes with a ready to encash cheque worth five hundred thousand pesos. But that's not all you're getting paid for this potential project. If the training and launching of our new star is successful, as well as her first porn project, we will each get 5 Million pesos each. Five million?! Where's that little squirt? Let's make her into a pornstar. - Real quick. - Right now! Let's go! - She's got the looks. - Flawless. Big boobies. Not her. That's Twinkle. She's one of our helpers in the estate. The help? Those two. Agatha and Sofia. Two girls who would do anything for the limelight. They're on every audition. They practically grew up in show business, well-versed in the needs of the industry. They've been playing bit parts since they were little. In short, exactly what we need. - They are… - horny ass bitches! …ambitious. Do you feel intimidated? A little. Just a little? You should be super nervous. Sorry, miss? You should be super nervous. You should be scared. Because you won't just be learning from seasoned bold stars. All of our experiences and wisdom we will teach you everything. So you will gain all that is right and should be. You should be nervous because four women who have had to go through many hardships will be imparting their knowledge to you about how to do things right. How to do things right? But why do we have to become pornstars all of a sudden? Why can't we be a bold star like you? Or a sexy star, whatever you guys used to call it. Believe me, you want something more than what we were. Don't you have a family, miss? What does it matter? You are my family now. Your beauty is truly one of a kind. As is yours, miss. Do you really think so? Yes, miss. But you still haven't answered my question. Which question? Why do we have to do porn right off the bat? Why don't you try producing sexy movies again? Just sexy. When was the last successful sexy film that you watched? Fifty Shades of Grey? Sex and the City? You can count it with your fingertips. Who still watches sexy movies in the cinema? When you can watch porn at the comfort of your house? Look at them. Who is still watching their old films? They have been forgotten. Worn-out. You can't even see their movies in YouTube, in Netflix. They've lost their luster. They've lost their allure. And they're broke. But the pornstars… their works will remain. The internet isn't going anywhere. At the tip of your fingertips. Sasha Grey, Maria Ozawa, Mia Khalifa. They have all retired. But they still get paid! Before I give you the syllabus of our month-long workshop. We need to discuss the breakdown of the demography of porn first. I have to discuss to you the demography of porn. What is demography? It is the statistics of the people who watch porn. Group, age, gender, preferences, etc. And here is what is interesting… Did you know that Filipinos reportedly spend the most time on porn sites? That's according to the world's number one porn sites in the world. We're looking at two factors that contribute to this. Either we have such a slow internet connection, or we're just a really horny bunch Can I smoke first? Oh, here. I have a vape. Want to try? - No, no. - Here. I'm fine. I don't want that. Your oral fixations are really showing, huh? Wait, wait. I don't get what you're trying to say. Oral frus-fay... Fixation, big sis. Fixation. Fix-a-tion. Fixation. Fine, fixation. Yes, yes. That's why I'm asking because I don't know what it means, alright? We're here to learn, aren't we? Well, in Psychology, it means you were probably stuck in your oral stage of development. Freud's Psychosexual Development. Maybe your childhood needs weren't sufficiently satisfied. You were not satisfied, or the manner of breastfeeding was wrong or excessive. As you grow up, you'll become overdependent. As you resort to persistent oral stimulation. Smoking, nail-biting. Blowjob! Whatever! All I know is I got my first milk from my father. You're too much! Take your cigar break, Osang. Five minutes. Because we are the world's top consumers that gives us a lot of hope. Father's wishes can be realized. Cinema and porn. Since 1997, the porn industry settled into the internet. Nearly 80% consumed through mobile phones. But wait, isn't there a law against showing porn in cinemas? So, do we go for online content? And we will get to that topic soon. But in the mean time, let's pick apart the demographics. So, who watches porn? According to recent statistics, it's 75% male, and 25% female. And the top consumers fall within the 18-24 years age bracket. Which is 30% So, what do you think is the most viewed category? Take a guess. Ah, Japanese! Wait! It's MILF! Mom I Like to Fuck! Celebrities! Big dick? Threesome! Scandal! Amateur. Am I right? I'm not an expert but I know that because when I watch porn, that's what I search for. I love watching amateur sex videos. You really see them fiddling nervously. You can hear the rooster's cockadoodle. The dogs barking in the background, the buzz from the news they're watching on TV even the commercial jingle while they do their thing. Correct! Genuine, you can feel the love. Intense. Whatever, I still prefer the ones in uniform and you can see the name. And when they enter the hotel Boom! You catch the name of the hotel on the bed sheets! That's just how it is. - They're pressed with time. - Motel. Just making the most of stolen moments. Correct! But what if their devices run out of memory? That's why it's an amateur video. Because they're amateurs. Why don't you just admit that I'm right? Yes, of course. You're correct. Amateur videos are the most viewed category. And you are right about your observations, why amateur videos are interesting. Back then, you needed a famous lead star to have any chance of selling. Now, you need to show some skin for a slice of the stage. Even the celebrity has-beens slither back to relevance when they're involved in a scandal. In our case, we will make our persona. Say, pretend she's a private person. We will exploit her privacy Until she becomes a household name. A sex symbol. Forever amateur. Which brings me to our syllabus of our month-long workshop. As you may notice, we left a lot of spaces to be filled in by you. Because you are here precisely to help us develop the master plan. Voyeurism. Amateur videos sell like hotcakes because of voyeurism. It's the most natural thing for humans, for Filipinos, to gossip, to get in on the action. Initial gimmick: leaked photos. Leaked photos? Leaked photos! Leaked photos. Licked photos. You mean they will have to lick the photos? Big sis Nes, leaked photos. Compromising photos released and spread to the media. Why didn't you just say \"spread\" photos then? Whatever. We're going to release a teaser. A sample taste. How do we do this? Your opinions matter. Okay, so we're going to come up with characters, that are based on their supposed private identities. How are we tackling damage control? I mean… how are we going to stop the people who know them in real life from revealing their true identities? Good question, Maui. I'll introduce you to our stars. You haven't met them yet. But you will, in the coming days. And your questions will be answered. I have an idea! - What? - Ex's Revenge. Guy blackmails girl, so girl comes back to him. But the girl has made up her mind but she forgot that they have a lot of their private moments captured and stored in guy's phone. So this guy, furious out of extreme jealousy, he uploads the pictures, leaked the photos on the internet Licked? Spread! God, Osang, isn't this illegal? {\\an3}I'm sure it's not. We won't be using a real person without their consent. It's nothing like that. I'm just making sure. Because, I care. - Alma Cares. - Fuck that. Alright, hold on a second. Let's focus. Okay. So our first gimmick is going to be the leaked pho... I mean spread photos, right? So, what? What's our plan, do we go for topless first? Yes, and it should be blurred. Okay. Blurred. No, this is what we're going to do. Let's make them wear white. Those stark white camisoles then we'll get them wet so you can see their breasts clearly, nips and all. That's going to be so wow. Eva Fonda 16, very innocent. Sounds good. Right? Then let's teach them how to get into the water and emerge in the most seductive way. - Yes! - Perfect. Soaking wet with their boobs popping out. That's it. Truly, they are windows to the soul. Not the eyes. Hmm. Interesting. The boobs are the windows of the soul. Actually, in Psychology, there's this thing called the Male Gaze Theory. Damnit, Ara. I'm getting so annoyed with you. My brain is having a hard time catching up with your brain. You're saying all these terms! I've had enough. Male gaze, according to feminists, is a way of looking at {\\an3}women in the eyes of men, often as sexual objects. Recent eye-tracking studies show that the male gaze is fixated on breasts and waists. Not so much on the hips or pelvis. There is also an MHR, ratio that determines the sexiness and attractiveness of a woman. Biologically, a swelling on the chest signals fertility. And wide hips signify a healthy womb. Men, as animals, just want to reproduce subconsciously and are always in search of a healthy carrier. This is our first activity, okay. This was my idea. Mine. It's ours. The wet look was all the rage back in the day. Yes. With the nipples sticking out through your shirt. You were the instigator. You're always picking on me. - No, you! - Okay, go. Now, to be an effective sexy star, you should know how to make men crazy as you come out of the water. Okay? As you rise up, give your whole body a generous feel. Your nipples… It's up to you. Point is to get the viewers feeling horny. Especially you, yeah? Yes, ma'am. Do it right or I'll smack you. Unless you hear this knocking, don't come out yet. Yes, ma'am. - You should wait for this, okay? - Yes, ma'am. - Knocking on the drums, really? - Get in there. Okay. How about you two? Man, let me tell you, back in the day, we were shooting the film Kandungan. I didn't know how to swim! Then the director told me, \"you need to show them the selling point!\" - She has big boobs. - So, I dove into the water. - They thought I was swimming but… - But? But my breasts were keeping me afloat. My feet were just paddling beneath the water. - You were just pretending? - Nobody noticed it when the movie came out. When you get your breasts done… they're natural floaters. You just float, huh? - They're your lifesavers. - What? Yeah, when you augment them, you'll float naturally. You will float. What? Really? - Yes! - Oh, mine are real, so. Real. I'm sorry, not to brag but I have the real thing. But for my first movie, called No Experience. That was from Regal Films... Ah, in the 60s. You motherfucker. You bastard! Wait, did they make sexy films then? - You idiot, you're so gullible. - She was joking. Was it 1976 or '77? I made the magic camison a thing! - Yes, that's true. It was her. - Oh shut up, you wore a camison too. It was so white and see through. And of course, my breasts were the real deal. See? You can see the nipples right through. They could see your undies. I looked so sexy. I had the most innocent face, right? - Hey, you better believe it. - Yes, you do. - She's right. - That's what it was about. I was starring in Eva Fonda 16 at the time when I had to do all those dances. Something like that! - Wow! - It's true! Fuck you! You keep teasing me, you bitch! Regal Films love that trope. - That camison. - Oh, wait. - Did you wear the ma... you wore it too? - I also had my version of the magic camison! I knew it! She wore the camison, too! - Everyone went through the camison phase. - True. {\\an3}I can never forget that time I made an action film and what they made me wear... it wasn't a camison. It was a white T-shirt with no bra underneath. They let me have shorts on, at least. Because I had to run near a dam. - A dam? - Yes. Your nipples would be the last thing on your mind. - But it was sticking out! - You didn't bother covering it up. I didn't have time, what if the dam broke, right? {\\an3}- Yes, yes. - And they made it into a poster without telling me! - Oh, that was with Lito Lapid! - Yes, I was with Lito Lapid! Oh, speaking of camison. Of course, it originated in Regal. - Yes. - But it reached Viva, the camison. - They adapted the camison. - Right? Another magic camison. {\\an3}- Yeah, Rica Peralejo and I were shooting a movie. - Uhuh. So we were at Daranak Falls. The scene went like, I was the liberated one so my nips were showing through my shirt. - And we had to French kiss. - Okay. Okay, then so we were about to kiss, getting closer. How? Can you do it again? Ugly kissing! We were both puckered up, when a snake slithered by between us out of the blue! - What? For real? - Is that true? - It is! - Good thing it didn't bite you. If only another kind of snake had passed by. Oh, big sis, who bought these drums? This one? I bought it. Just look here, of course. - It has an Alma Cares sticker. - I knew it. - Isn't it obvious? - I bought them, you got a problem with that? Nothing. You don't fit in those... - That's why you're not in one, yeah? - Let me see you try to fit in there. You're the one with the problem, fuckhead. {\\an3}- I can make it work. - Let me see, fuck, with those giant boobs? Hello? Ah, the other girl, it doesn't look like she's still breathing. The other one still has bubbles. Is that okay? Huh? Oh shit. Fuck, this is your fault. - Why me? - It's you. It was your idea. Hey! Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Was that okay? Yes, sure. What about you, are you okay? I'm fine, ma'am. Great, see? This one won't come out. Not following instruction. - Idiot. - Hey, wake up! You're going to get yourself in trouble. Is she okay? - Hey, are you okay, dear? - Check if she's still breathing? - Mister, is she alive? - Yes, yes, she's alive. Ah, alright. Take her away. Keep her alive. Wait, hold on. Wait a minute. Get well soon. See, I told you. She was going to get herself in trouble. Ugh, we just lost a talent. - Watch it! - It was in the way. I thought you were concerned. I am concerned. Really, Alma Cares? It's a good thing she survived. So what happens now? Well, we lost a talent. But we should still be thankful. No matter, we still have one girl left. Let's give thanks to Lord nothing serious happened to the girl. Let's not do the wet look. Let's just have her jiggle her boobs. That will do. Ah, yes. Like a sexy calendar girl. Very classy. Like those calendar girls for Tanduay. Ha! Wait, like commercials. White Castle commercial. - That's right! White Castle! - You're right. We'll need a horse. Yes, but let's not make her wear white. It should be red. To add intensity. - Red! - Bloody! Perfect! Sounds great! Erase the water scene. Go for the horse! Let's eat. Go for the horse! Alma Cares, am I right? Is it campaign period? Just let me be! - Both of you, stop it! - Fine! Okay, we're starting now. Remember: stick out your breasts and buttocks while you're riding on the horse. And don't just stick out your assets. While you're riding, you should be swaying your hair with the wind. Like so! So sexy! You're so corny! The only thing she's supposed to do is to stick out her breasts and her buttocks while she rides around. Got it? Huh? You sound like a bunch of idiots. Who are you calling an idiot? I just repeated what Maui said. So just make sure your breast smacks against your face while the horse gallops. That's sexy. Isn't that right. Did you hear them? You don't have a name yet. Don't disobey us. Just keep doing what we tell you. I'll be the one to teach you the cooler tricks. Got it? Different from what they'll be teaching you. Now, do everything that they asked you to do. But once the horse gallops, let go. What? Didn't you hear what they said? You're still green. You should be more tenacious! Do everything we asked you to! First of all, stick out your butt and your boobs while you're riding the horse. Second, sway your hair around in the wind. When you do that, it will look good in slow motion. Third, what's the third one? Smack your breasts against your face. There! You need to… I want to see your face bruised. Hey, you're too much! I was just kidding. And fourth, while you're doing all that, yeah… Let go. I'm telling you, you little shit, do what we tell you. I'm watching you. Can you do it? I can do it, ma'am! Then get on with it! What are you waiting for? - That's it! - You got! Smack your breasts against your face! Sway your hair with the wind! Sexy! Stick out your boobs and butt! - Perfect! - Here it comes! The horse is galloping! Hurry! Let go! - Good! - Let go! Let go now! Ahh! Fuck! - Fuck! - Shit! Fuck! She fell! Ah, wait. Just wait for me. Okay. Alma Cares. Now we don't have a pornstar! This is a problem. What now? This is on you, Osang. You were making the kid do weird things! You kept running your mouth. Well, who told her to smack her breasts against her face? Wasn't that you? That's why she fell. She couldn't balance her breasts. Whatever! Let's not blame each other. We need to find a new subject. Right. Let's chill and have a drink. Maybe we can make a Plan C. Plan C. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I think so. It could work. You want to have a go at the swing? You silly! We don't want to use the swing! Look behind you. We have a new student. Look at her. Ah, is that what you meant? You're crazy. Everytime you open your mouth, it's to pick on me. Ah, Twinkle. We want to propose a project. Don't worry, we'll make you into a star. But there are things we need you to do. - Please say yes. - You can do it. We will conduct workshops. - Like the one using the drum, right? - Yes, yes. Just listen to the four of us. You will dive. The truth is I know all of these. You just don't notice it, but I listened to all of your lessons. From having an ambition, why I should strive to be a pornstar. The proper way to make men go crazy. To keep the audience thrilled. How to ride a horse properly. I studied everything you don't know. What you don't know, I do. Plan C. Initial photos: leaked photos. Check. Check. - Wet shirt, nips sticking though. Check. - Check. If we have photo teasers, we should also have voice teasers. I agree. The audio teaser has to be something like… a little whimper. We used to do that back in high school. We used casette tapes, we would play it and match the voices. You used to do that too, right, Nes? Pfft! I'm a decent woman. Me getting naked was purely professional work. Yeah right! Good idea. Audio teaser. We can make it seem like a phone sex. Like your movie, yeah? And she'll send a voice recording. That's very sexy. You know, the right facial expression is important. When you whimper and moan, you've got to have the right body language that go with it. And at the same time, so you get in the groove of it, you have to… you have to show the whites of your eyes. Have you ever climaxed? Do you know what happens when a woman reaches climax? Huh? Her legs go stiff. And her back arches. And her fingers want to grab and scratch. And she bites her lips Sometimes you make the same sounds like when you're pooping. I have to agree. Even in the BPO industry, it's a rule of thumb. When you smile, you sound happy. The voice follows what the face is doing. Ah, fuck! Hey! Make it more intense. What the fuck. - Yeah! - Okay. Intense. Intense. You sound like you're trying to scare someone, you idiot. That was intense. - Geez, give it your all. - Your all! Everything! Fine, I'm giving it all. Twinkle. Oh, hey. Listen to me. Curacha, The Girl Who Never Sleeps. First day in cinemas. 77 Million, you got me? There were only 50 cinemas back then. Watch me. This part is for when you're about to climax, alright. Fuck, feels so good! Mic test. - Test. Test. - Hey! What are you doing? That's Mic's testes. Moan! You see, I just remembered our first meeting de avance Fuck that! Start moaning! Fine, here I go. Alma Cares.. Great job. Fuck, you're so good! Yay! Good work! I'm going to show you something. No one's ever done this before. This should be in the Kama Sutra. This is called The Forbidden Technique! I call it \"The Tornado!\" Alma Cares... So, we have leaked photos for our initial gimmick then the audio sample. The interval should probably be around a week or a month, maybe two months apart. No, it depends on the public's reaction. When we go for one month, it's a long wait. They'll tire of it. Alright, fine, a week apart. It still depends. Keep the mystery. The art of keeping them hanging. Why does it feel good to be kept hanging? It doesn't always. But it produces a certain pleasures because our brains will fill in what's missing. You know what, I think when guys so much as hear about rape in the news, they'll jerk themselves off. That's how their minds work. When they see a girl twerking, they'll think, \"cowgirl position\". When they see a girl eating a banana, they'll think \"blowjob\". When they see a girl washing her face, they'll think \"cumshot\". That's what makes them so easy to bait. Huh, in fairness, Cinderella's glass slipper, I bet it has some sexual undertones in between. Fetish. Keeping the prince hanging. So, are we all in agreement about the one week interval? I'm good with one week. Okay... Then we'll go for audio on week two? Okay, week four... it should be the final week. Her launch. What about week three? Right, we have an audio teaser, a leaked photo, what's next? Video. Video of what? Like you said, the one where she's eating a banana. Yeah? We're going to take a video of her eating as if she were performing a blowjob! You know what, I have a brilliant idea. Ever seen those Facebook tutorials? The ones that look like cooking shows? Those are getting lots and lots of attention. So what, we're going to make a video tutorial on doing blowjobs? Yes! It would be too vulgar to use a real penis. Then use an imaginary penis. I know, let's go for ice candy. So it looks innocent. Are you with me? I like it better. I'm fine with anything. Even the barrel man from Baguio? I'll suck on that. Let's concur. Ice Candy. Okay. Not that. Drop it. You're so annoying. You're not listening to me. Scroll down to the pink background. They're crazy about that look in social media. Heh. Do what you want. I'm just curious… when you were with sir Dolphy, would his penis get hard? Oh, you don't say. It's all it ever does. Dolphy... Why did you turn pale? - Uncle Dolphy was a kind man. - Of course. Are you scared? He might haunt us. Because we have a hard ice candy, let's start our VTR. But we can also give tips on how to give a felatio chick on this humble old ice candy. Okay, shush. Watch. This is how you do it, okay. Lick around the edges. Don't laugh, jeez. - You're being silly. - Just like that. Pretend this ice cream... I mean ice candy is a cock. What do you do when ice cream drips? You lick it. You're so good at this. That's how it's done. That's how you treat a penis. Ice candy! It's the same thing. Here, ice candy. Correct. You better listen up. Start from the bottom and work your way to the tip. This is how you do it. Just stare at it. Be quiet. You. - Here. - How? Show us, quick. God's sake! - I can't concentrate! - Hurry up. Teach her! - Is this right? - Good job! Check. I'm sorry, I don't know how to do this. This is how you do it. There we go. With feelings. Put more feelings. That's enough. - So, what. - Then, do this. You're going to bury it in your mouth, like so. When it's inside your mouth, snug. Just leave it there or about five to ten seconds. What happens when it's inside your mouth? - Push it deeper. - Deeper. It won't go any deeper. But I throw up easy. Silly girl! It's called a gag reflex. Christ. You can train your throat to be desensitized... so you won't want to throw up. Correct! - It's a big one. - Practice on it. You really know how to put it in your mouth. You're so good at this! I'm just starting. What's the matter? Is it really that big? Do you want a dick or what? Ice candy! Pfft. This will do. It's soft, wrapped in plastic. It's as good as any dick. And now that we've done everything for our three weeks of uploads Before the final week of launching. We've reached the most important part of our workshop. We're going to talk about how to roast a pig? Huh? Oh my god, that's not in the budget. Are we supposed to pay for catering, too? Wait, what were you thinking, Ara? Don't tell me our gimmick for the launch is to show Twinkle piped with a bamboo? Will she enter the press conference turning round and round? Did you really have to say \"piped\"? Theatrical. I like it. Yeah, and you'll both be in cauldrons. - Watch your tongue. - You sorry lot. You and your crazy ideas. That's what you get for not undergoing training from the one and only, Papang! That's right! Anyway, Osang, Nes, you'll be in charge of the preparations. And Maui, you're the voice of the cooking show. And Twinkle. You watch and learn! Watch and learn! Ingredients. Of course, we need… a pig. Make sure it's around 18 to 20 kilos. Mm, there. Okay. Next, we need salt... Salt. And black pepper. Black pepper. In Tagalog, paminta. And of course, let's not forget we all have this… soy sauce! For the glaze, make sure you have one bottle of clear softdrinks. - What's your problem? I'm thirsty! - Keep it together. - You're always pulling this shit. - Killjoy. And for the stuffings, ten bundles of lemongrass, one fourth cup of star anise, six pieces of bay leaves, cut into small pieces, five cloves crushed garlic, two kilos of onion leaves, and of course, our favorite... eight pieces of half-cooked saba. Teach me. I've already forgotten how to do it. Joey didn't teach you? G! First, shave hair follicles of the pig and remove the innards. A certain sexy star... I mean, porn star has to be flawless. Like this. She should be free of innards. Nothing but an empty shell. That way, no conscience would trouble her. And she'll have no shame. So she won't say things like, \"I can't take it!\" Rinse the pig and make sure there are no more lumps of blood inside the stomach. She should always be hygienic. Always with an inviting scent about her. Then rub inside with salt and pepper including the body. Salt, like salty tears. Sad experiences that add flavor to a woman. And of course, the black peppers... {\\an3}which represent life expectations and ideologies that got broken and crushed to pieces. Failures in life. Flavorful. Now rub a little soy sauce on the inside, belly of the pig. Don't forget about this bit. This is very important. Because all of us girls have it. A bit of crazy. Stuff the belly with saba banana. They represent all your sexual relations with men. Of course, you should know who they are. What they like, and what they really like. Ohh! These saba are so big! - What's with you? - Did sir Dolphy's look like this? Do you miss him? Put the star anise inside. The ambition, the dream. The glamour of being famous. It has a lot. And of course, don't forget, the onion green leaves and crushed garlic. Onion leaves. Things that remind you of your failures. As for the garlic... antiseptic. Your protection from intrigue and defamation. That way you don't lose your determination. And of course, the laurel leaves. Leaves. Sign of your brief education about what you are doing. That's what our workshops are for. Next, stuff the lemongrass in the center of the stomach. You should always have something up your sleeve. So they can't easily brush you off. So they wont't get tired of you! Correct! Stitched the belly, making sure that no ingredients slip out. Skewer the pig with a mid-size bamboo and split roast over hot charcoal. While slowly roasting the pig, glaze it from time to time with sprite using a sponge. This will make the skin extra crispy. You have to listen to some criticism. Constructive or not, these will make you famous. And most of all, be patient. Don't be hasty, don't be too quick to act. Wait it out. Even if you are the most delicious dish. The most inviting look, color, beauty, and the most fragrant. For a lot of people, you're still nothing but a... No matter how much you've mastered your craft, no matter how much you've mastered your craft, people will still think you are their property. Something they can eat, devour, feast upon. You may be flawless, fragrant, scrumptious… but the moment you're thrown into the fire, you're nothing but meat. I'm sorry, I really can't go a day without hearing your voice. But didn't I tell you I'll call you first? Yes, but Twinkle, I need your answer now. Just hold tight. I'm not sure about my decisions yet. What about our plans? I need to know. Please, can you be more patient? Here she is. Here comes Twinkle. Twinkle, we're live now. Say hi to your fans in Paranaque! Here we are. Hi, Ms. Twinkle! Hello, my little stars. How are you? You should be going on FB live more often. Because you already have 1 million subscribers! It will really make your followers happy, Ms. Twinkle! He's right! - And you can talk to your fans too. - Oh, yeah. We support you! - We're really excited! - Yes! They seem really excited. Look. Listen here, Twinkle. Just imagine. We're preparing for your launch tomorrow. And I'm pretty sure, your fans will have all sorts of questions. We already went over that. Wait, won't we be joining her FB live? Right, my friends over at Paranaque will be waiting for me for sure. Alright fine, here's what we'll do. Let's all join her at the start. But Twinkle will be the one to address her online fans. - Is that alright? - Go! - Okay, let's just make the introductions. - Let's do this! Hold on, let's fix the light so we look pretty. Okay! Let's go! - Go on then, click it. - We're going live, alright? Okay. - There we go. - Hello, little stars! You might be wondering why all four of us are with Twinkle today! {\\an3}And of course, just like each and every one of you, we are here to support our newest bombshell! And like you, we're excited for Twinkle's media conference tomorrow. So keep your questions coming but we'll save the shoutouts for later, okay? Let's start reading some questions. Here's our first one. Hi, Twinkle. I just want to ask about your skincare and also the aunties'. Who are you calling an auntie? So, guys, my skincare is nothing special. Facial wash, at night I apply some toner and moisturizer before I go to bed. You know what, I did the same thing when I was starting out. But now I go to Allura Face and Body. You can find it in Quezon City. And I used my own beauty products calle Ara Secret You can also apply to be a distributor, Contact us. That's all, okay. Me, I go to European Aesthetics. That's by Doctora Doris Velasco. And uh, all their products are imported from Belgium so you will love it there. They have an RF called Nanic RF. That's my favorite treatment. At the same time, I also use my own products. I also have a skincare line. You can find us on Instagram. Just type natureskinsecret. That's all for me. As for me, Doctora Anna Montesa attends me in her Morato clinic. She's the one who injects me with stemcell and RF, too. So as you ca see, even at my age, I don't look too shabby. Alma Cares, am I right? To manage my fats, I undergo this thing called cryoscrystals. - It's a kind of non-invasive liposuction... - Oh, okay. They freeze the fats. - Hmmm. - Yes. So you've heard all of our skincare routine. Let's move on to the next question. Hi, Twinkle. Is pink the color of your… No, let's pick this one. Hi, Twinkle. I want to ask what your favorite position is... - Maui, Maui. Look at this. - What? \"Is that Maui Taylor?\" - \"She doesn't look like she aged at all.\" - Wow! \"Her face still looks like it's been waxed.\" \"Don't stick around that bitch, Twinkle.\" \"She has an attitude problem. Feeling famous.\" Ah, you think I have an attitude problem? - Well, fuck you. - Shh. Hey! {\\an3}- I'm going to show you who's got an attitude problem! - We're live online. Fuck you! I will find you on Facebook... and when I see you, I will break you face, you fucker. Wait, here's another one. - Look, big sis Osang. You also have an admirer. - What does it say? Quick, read it. - Here's what it says. - I can't see. \"Is that Rosana Roces?\" \"Why does she look like that? She's gotten so fat!\" \"She put on so much weight!\" \"It makes me sick!\" \"That's what you call karma.\" \"Keep stuffing your face!\" Fuck you! My butthole looks better than you! Osang! Osang! Wait, wait. I got something. Move over there. Move! Move! Who? Who are you calling a moron? Hey! I will have you know, I was the one who set up this live stream! And what's your basis? For saying I'm stupid? Because I pretend to not speak English fluently? You bastard! It's called Imaging. Packaging! If I want to speak in English, you know With no… no wrong gr... You son of a bitch! I prefer not to speak in English but I can if I want to! Fuck you! Fuck these bashers. Is it gone? At least I experienced what it's like to be beautiful. I was sexy, I was fantasized upon, and thousands of horny men jacked off to me! What's that bashes got to show for? Shit, he's probably not even getting laid! Hey, all of you. Jeez, you're so sensitive. You know, every little thing you do, fans will always have an opinion about it. What the fuck? Fans? You call those fans? Back then, they would hang flowers around our necks! They don't talk down on us, curse at us. What's wrong with you? Maui only meant that... {\\an3}Bashers and supporters are all the same. Anyone who gives you the time of day is considered a fan. They contribute to these views and engagement. Sometimes, they're the ones that make it viral. Fuck being viral. I'd rather get low views than be judged like that. Just because we work in front of the camera and they pay to watch us, does that mean they have the right to insult us? What they pay us is nothing. Does paying give them the right to swear at us? Just because we're has-beens? Hey Nes, I'm not a has-been, alright. You're the has-been. I thought I was the only idiot in this room but you're worse than me. You can't even accept reality. If I'm not famous anymore, why do I still get cast in TV series? You're not famous anymore. What kind of roles do you get? Mother roles! Mother roles! That's how you know. What, getting mother roles doesn't mean I'm not famous. You're not! You're a nobody! You're a nobody! Hey! Excuse me. I'm not a nobody. I have die-hard fans. There's tons of them. Besides, I'm a public servant. I work in public servant! That's right. The reason you ran for office is because you're not famous anymore. Fuck you, if I'm a nobody, then you're not any better. We are all nobodies! We are all nobodies! It's her turn now. We're done, Osang. We're done, Nes. They've already used us up as much as they could. The only thing left that they can do... is to compare us to the new ones. We've long budded and bloomed. Don't you know that? They've plucked out all our petals. We've shown them everything, they sniffed the last whiffs of our scents. Our aroma has faded, gone is our fragrance Our careers are over. We're not fresh anymore. We're rotting. If we were flowers, we'd be all dried up. They won't even offer us to the dead. We're dried up flowers. We've all become dead flowers. Oh, how fragrant Oh, how fragrant this flower is. When I take a whiff, when I take a whiff. When I take a whiff, what pleasure! Fragrant, so fragrant, feels so good, feels so good. To smell the flower. Oh, it's so big, so big. Oh, how big this flower is. Oh, it's so red, so red. Oh, how red this flower is. So big and so red the color of the flower. The flower blooms, and in comes the queen. She'll dance the cha-cha, what a joy! What a joy! Boom-ti-ya-ya, Boom-ti-ya-ya, boom-ye-ye. Boom-ti-ya-ya, Boom-ti-ya-ya, boom-ye-ye. Oh, it's so thick, so thick. Oh, how thick this flower feels. There are tiny ones. There are smelly flowers, too. There are thick ones, there are wispy ones. Flowers of different kinds. The flower blooms, and in comes the queen. She'll dance the cha-cha, what a joy! What a joy! Boom-ti-ya-ya, Boom-ti-ya-ya, boom-ye-ye. Boom-ti-ya-ya, Boom-ti-ya-ya, boom-ye-ye. We need flowers in our lives. To make the world more colorful. Flowers, flowers. We need flowers in our lives. Make sure everything looks good. How? Cheers. - Make sure everything looks good. - Yes, ma'am. There you go. Very nice. Okay. What? Why are you screaming? You're so loud! It's so early! What's the matter? I was awake, I was just collecting my thoughts. Somebody was collecting her thoughts without us knowing. Huh? Who? She sent me this. Looks like she recorded us when we were drunk. My dear sisters, I'm apologizing right off the bat for what I am about to tell you. And if we ever cross paths again, I'm sure you'll either pretend I don't exist or slap me across the face. But I know, you will understand me. Even before we began with our project, I had been carrying a child in my womb. But that did not stop me from pursuing my dream of becoming like you. I told myself, I will never fail you. And so I had planned to get rid of it before the presscon. I also planned to break up with my boyfriend; I thought maybe he would get in the way of my career. Besides, I was getting sick of him asking my opinion on everything, until I realized that's actually a good thing. I also remembered my friends and relatives at the foundation when Miss Ness made me do some video greetings. There are people who are relying on me But don't worry. When I get back, I'll have a surprise for all of you. Of course, you will love it. I know you've been working so hard. Hello, Maja. Have you eaten? But when I was about to drink the medicine, I heard Miss Osang talking with her daughter and granddaughter so it occurred to me that I hope I could finish school, study and graduate. {\\an3}I think it would be nice to have something to be proud of, not just to everyone but also to myself… just like you sister Ara. But it got me thinking, I'm on the right path. Like I was saying, I want to become like you, but maybe I could skip through most of it, because you've paved the way for me, and my eyes are set on my destination. I know you won't appreciate losing your investment, and you might not think all our hardwork will have been wasted, but if I'm going to be honest, I think you've made a great success out of me. You taught me how to conduct myself, to be a living dream to aspire to. And more importantly, you taught me how to go after my own dreams. Hold on! Note: For the Mommy Note: For the Baby There she is. She got it. - She's seen it? - Yes. - Hey. - She got the cheque. I'm telling you, Ara. You better pay me back. - Yeah, yeah, I'll pay. - Look at you. What are you moaning about? We got to help her. What do we do now? Where are we supposed to find a new pornstar to train? - Exactly! - What do you mean \"where\"? They will come to us! Ahh, you mean we'll be holding auditions? - Yes! - Oh, I like the sound of that! Right? The search for the next Philippine Pornstar! Pretty grand, yeah? - I like that. - But gosh, She's still skinny, huh? - Even with a big tummy. - Yeah. If she ate all that iced candy, she'll blow up like a balloon. Are you sure? Watch Movies, Series & LiveTV www.flixify.app\n"

      "My family lived in Arnold Grove in the 1940s. The Liverpool Blitz was terrifying, and I will never forget as a child the drone of sirens and approaching bombers. The Grove's a really neighbourly place and we were always in and out of each other's homes. What was strange for me was the music coming out of the house at number 12, the home with the Harrison family. George's mother Louise loved to listen to Indian music on the radio. I'm told that it helped to keep her calm during her pregnancy. When I first heard Indian music, I just couldn't really believe that it was so, so great. And the more I heard of it, the more I liked it, and it just got bigger and bigger, like a snowball. One day, the telephone rang and my father always answered it. He had a particular sort of authentic Indian accent. His Indian accent had remained unchanged in all the 40 years he'd been here, and he was shouting down the telephone, \"Ringo who, Ringo who?\" And apparently it was because Ringo was on the other end of the line asking my father whether he had a spare sitar string. The return of the heroes to their native land. They conquered the colony. The Beatles, who originated as a small-time act out of Liverpool, now have no rivals as the kingpins of the teenage set. The group had certainly turned Liverpool into Britain's answer to any pop trends from across the Atlantic. On every side there is hero worship that recall the heydays of Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra. Beatlemania has ceased to be a phenomenon and seems to have become a way of life. My father had never heard of The Beatles so he knew nothing about anything European or popular. But what happened was that they'd broken a sitar string while George was recording \"Norwegian Wood\" in Abbey Road Studio. EMI knew my father because he was often the person they came to when they required a group of musicians. So, when the string broke, they found my father and he did have one, amazingly, he did have a set of sitar strings. So the whole family got in the tiny little car and they all drove to carry one string to Abbey Road and there they handed it over and they watched them recording. It started with the Indian music. I like so many Indian instruments, but mainly sitar. I'd used a little sitar on our records. The Beatles had already discovered Indian music, I think when they were making \"Help!\" Which is, of course, the story of a mystic Eastern religious group, and they are after Ringo Starr's ring. So they'd already discovered, and there's that famous scene about them going into a restaurant. On the set of how a sitar was used in a sort of little group that's playing in the restaurant, George picked it up and was playing with it and sort of got interested in sitar because of that. It was a very inappropriate film for most Indians because that film really lived up to all the stereotypes about India, about bloodthirsty thug cult. The goddess, which was named as Kylie, was really based on a real goddess, the Kali goddess, Hindus are very reverential to her. So the whole film would be offending a lot of Indians. And then there was this book on the yoga. While they're on shoot at Bahamas, the suddenly come across this very diminutive yogi who cycles up to where they are and distributes this book. This is Vishnudevananda, the first illustrated book on yoga going across the West. But I don't think The Beatles paid him much attention. I think much later he thought back and there was this sort of very mysterious connection. The palace of the Queen has lived through many historic events, and it's our privilege today to witness one of the most earth shaking, The Beatles. Fresh from an audience with the Queen, they hold medals indicating they have been made members of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. The Beatles, of course, have proven to be one of Britain's prime exports. They have brought in more foreign exchange than many industries. And the Queen saw fit to reward their economic contribution to the nation. The award entitles The Beatles to put the letters MBE after their names. That was the most miserable time of our lives, was the MBE cop-out period. We got an MBE, which is one of the biggest jokes in the history of this island probably. The great cavalcade of empire makes a grand spectacle. One of the smallest countries on the map is responsible for the mightiest Commonwealth of nations in history. India was always in British lives because of the empire. We knew about tea and we knew about, you know, rubber, but the idea of its music being, in any way, an influence on anything from this country was simply not considered. From the music that I play to get better and better, musicians generally, in the West, progress into, say, modern jazz, but when I first heard Indian music, there was so much more freedom and there was so much more in it compared to jazz. I just couldn't really believe that it was so, so great. I don't know, then I just started to listen to it more and more, and to try and listen a bit closer. And the more I heard of it, the more I liked it. My mother meets The Beatles in India well before I'm even born. I think she, by virtue of being in the \"Hindustan Times\" at that point, being a preeminent journalist, being a chief reporter, got the opportunity, but didn't really see, my God, the magic of that moment. And you know, I'm always asked, what's the one thing about your mother that you would have really wished you would do. And she's been Indian first woman war correspondent. She's done all kinds of crazy trailblazing thing. And I always look at this photograph and I say, \"My God, I wish I had been that person sitting between John and Paul.\" This was the first time The Beatles had, as a group, come to India. And they symbolised to us, not just a new kind of music. It was almost like symbolising a new kind of life. They represented the whole sixties to us. When I heard they were in Delhi, I went to the Oberoi InterContinental, and I sat in the lobby and everyone was circling all the different entrances of the hotel, waiting for The Beatles to come out by the kitchen entrance, by various ways. I sat near the lift and I waited for Brian Epstein to emerge because I knew he was their manager. And sure enough, after a few hours of waiting, I saw him come down and I sidled up to him and I said, \"Excuse me, Mr. Epstein, I am from All India Radio. The government have scheduled an interview with The Beatles.\" And he stopped in his tracks and looks at me, \"How dare you! The boys will not give an interview. How dare you!\" I said, \"I'm just conveying the decision of the government because this interview has been announced and it would be very embarrassing if this didn't happen.\" \"I will not permit this,\" he said, \"well, I will give the interview.\" I said, \"Good enough for me, sir, Brian Epstein, good enough for me.\" Is there going to be any change in the sort of work that they do? Possibly, 'cause, as I've said before, there's no dynamic or important change but The Beatles have always progressed. And to progress, they have to change. At seven o'clock I go up in the lift, I get out and I walk to the end of the corridor. I knock and there's Brian Epstein in a bathrobe, sweating. He emerges, walks me across the length of the hotel, opens the suite on the other side of the floor, and then I was in with The Beatles, all four of them. I asked them what they were doing and they said they had an album coming out in a month's time. George Harrison mentioned that he had an Indian influence in one of the songs, which turned out to be, \"Love You To.\" And Paul mentioned that he had a classical arrangement behind one of the songs, which I think must have been \"Eleanor Rigby.\" Even then, they were going to be Indian influences in their songs. I personally hope there'll be more Indian influences just generally in any music because it's worth it. It's very good music. I just like to see it more popular, more people appreciating it. It was the 6th of July, 1966. Some foreigner came, they never knew what the name of the person were, but they were interested in buying some sitars, harmoniums, and tablas and sarod, and that's all. The huge crowd assembled here outside looking the new face of the English people, like the big hair and all that. It was a craze. My father and uncle went to the hotel and show an instrument, and, later on, gave lesson to George Harrison specially. After The Beatles, there was a big craze for sitars, tablas, and other instruments. In a day, in a month, we were selling sitar like hotcake. The famous Beatles, they came in 1966 to our stall. They were dressed very differently so that the people there could not recognise them. And they walked into the store and they started talking about Indian musical instruments, especially the sitar, the tambura, and the sarod, and also the tabla. He was a good sitar player, my father, and he was showing them how to play it and how the finger movements are, how to coordinate both left and right hand, and, you know, how to strike the strings, how to pluck the strings. They asked him whom he learned the sitar from, he said, \"With Ravi Shankar.\" Pa-pa-pa-pa, ah. Like this. Ravi Shankar, as I see it, was really the first ambassador for all musicians, artists, singers, dancers from India to the West. Over the last few years, I heard the name Ravi Shankar mentioned. A good friend of mine told me to buy a record, which I did. This was the first time I'd ever heard Indian music properly. But when I first heard it, I couldn't really, couldn't believe it really. He's also been turned onto Ravi Shankar, by the, like, David Crosby and Roger McGuinn from The Birds. 'Cause Ravi Shankar had appealed to, the sort of the Beat Generation, going back to the fifties actually. It was all part of that kind of ambiance. I'm sure you must have been asked this lots of times before, but what's your opinion of, sort of, English pop groups and American pop groups using the sitar and the Indian influence in their records? It will make me very happy if I see that some people take true interest and learn properly. Because after having played the sitar for 36 years, I feel that one has to give some time to it. Indeed. My father and my mother were running the Asian Music Circle. My father was quite successful at getting musicians to come to this country and he'd put on concerts for them. It was very much for erudite English people, intellectuals who knew about Indian music. Yehudi Menuhin, amazing man. He was the president to the Asian Music Circle, and I think it was through him that Ravi Shankar first came. And George was fascinated by our family, and so he was invited round to spend the afternoon. I think he came round for lunch. Pattie was there as well, and then George came quite regularly. Eventually, I said, if we could get Ravi free, and the time George was free, we'd invite them both together and introduce them and see whether they got on. And the doorbell rang and I rushed to the door and there wasn't George, it was Paul. Then Paul said, \"I'm Paul McCartney.\" And I said, \"I know.\" And he came in and a little while after that, I think George arrived next. And finally we met, very nicely, at somebody's house, having dinner. We met just as two people instead of being a big publicity gimmick. Ravi came in and we just said, \"Ravi, this is George, George this is Ravi.\" And we had a dinner there, we just ate and talked. Paul was a little bit on the outside actually, looking a little bit bored, smoking like a chimney. My young sister went around collecting the cigarette butts to take to school the next day, the used cigarette butts. And from then he offered to give me, to start me off on sitar with a few lessons, which he did. He had many students in India, very talented musicians. So to try to explain what drew George and Ravi Shankar together is not easy because it defies logic. When George Harrison came to me, I didn't know what to think. But I found he really wanted to learn. I never thought our meeting would cause such an explosion. That Indian music could suddenly appear on the pop scene. George said that, \"I want to learn the sitar,\" and Ravi, he said, \"Yes, I can teach you, but it's a very difficult instrument to learn, and you will have to spend a lot of time and your fingers will hurt. It's going to be a difficult thing for you to do, but I want you to come to India and I will teach you over there.\" So when Ravi invited George and me, I was thrilled to be going. You know, 22, I hadn't really thought much about it. I thought of the King's Road and you know, clothes. And we started off in Mumbai. Ravi took us to concerts, private concerts, that he gave in people's houses, and then bigger concerts in front of his students. George Harrison came with his wife, September 1966. You know, Pandit Ravi Shankar picks him up, he takes him to the Taj hotel and within about four hours, the whole of the people in Taj, it was just filled with people and media and fans, just coming in, shouting, \"George, George, George.\" So finally George got just fed up and he told Pandit, \"Let's give a press conference, Let's go and talk to the press.\" So, of course, Pandit Ravi Shankar was the music director of All India Radio for many years. So he said, let's go and do a radio interview, studio one. This is where Pandit Ravi Shankar and George Harrison did an interview. So we searched for it, and we actually opened quite a few spools, dusty spool lying in the side of a corner. And then we found George Harrison, there was a paper inside. It said \"George Harrison interview.\" The tape hadn't been played in maybe 30 years. Good afternoon, George. Good afternoon. We would like to know from you, do you think you could not make a public appearance? If I did want to make a public appearance, I would have come here to do a show, and I would've come with John and Paul and Ringo. It's just like, all our fans who go to school during the week. Well if they go on the holidays and suddenly somebody's making them learn maths and learn English and learn all this, then they don't like to do that when it's their holiday. It's the same for me. I go around having my photograph taken, signing autographs and waving at people, and being a Beatle, and when it comes to my holiday, then, naturally, I want to not be a Beatle, I wanna be me. When I was 19, I went to India. My aunt greeted me at the airport and said, \"Do you know that George Harrison is staying at the hotel?\" We asked around, you know, \"Where's Mr. Harrison,\" and we weren't told, and then sort of hopped onto the elevator, and we started going to floors, and then eventually there was one floor where there was a waiter standing outside a room. And I don't really know what made me do it, but I sort of hobbled in and George Harrison asked what I was doing there, and I just said, \"I would like your autograph, Mr. Harrison.\" And he said, you know, he sort of, he wasn't too happy about me being there. I also said to him, he had numerous fans outside the hotel, and his words were, which I've never, ever forgotten, \"Tell your friends if they like me, to keep away from me.\" Which I thought was rather nasty, but I needed the autograph. Everything that Ravi had shown us and told us about him, introduced us to, made an impact. He took us to the Ellora Caves, fascinating. And we went to Banaras, Varanasi. Banaras was unbelievable 'cause we came by boat and Ravi had explained to us the whole reason for people coming to Banaras to die. And they would request that they'd be burnt. And I was fascinated by this. The pyres and then the family or the wife or the husband taking it into the Ganges and letting their ashes float away. So Agra, we went to the Taj Mahal. It's beautiful, I love the story surrounding it. It was more exquisite than I could ever have described to anyone. And then, towards the end of our trip, Kumbh Mela. There were all these sadhus walking down the road, and I said, \"Ravi, what's they doing?\" He said, \"They walk hundreds of miles to come into this Kumbh Mela.\" And I was just watching this spectacle, and all these people, you know, families or groups and sadhus, all of India, it seemed. He also told us about Indian culture and spirituality. Ravi took us to meet his spiritual guru and this man was over 100. And obviously, we didn't know what they were saying, but it wasn't very many words. And Ravi is a reverential towards his guru. Throughout my life I look to the great yogi Taj Mirage, my spiritual guru. As a Hindu, I believe blessing of guru is the most priceless thing in life. It was very moving for me to see somebody as powerful as Ravi, but George adored him. And here he was humbled in front of his guru. Ravi said that there was something that I found in George, where he was so simple, so down to earth, he looked upon me like a guru, like a father, and he had absolutely no airs about him. And that is something -that we also observed- -That's true. When he came to our home, he was absolutely a simple person, not demanding anything. I haven't learned to play the sitar, I mean, Ravi Shankar hasn't learnt to play and he's been playing in 35 years. He was not a sitar player or a star musician, but I have not seen Ravi have so much time for someone. This association, this link, I can only explain it that they must've had some links in a previous life that brought them together. When George and we got connected in '66, it was like wildfire, you know. He's like a son to me. Same thing. Sometimes I feel like his dad as well. He can be. George Harrison, he loved India, he loved Indian music, he loved Indian spirituality. So this thing, you know, pushed Indian classical music on the top, you know, fusion we can call it, Western and Indian classical music. And that was the biggest fusion ever happened. And then Harrison came here to record \"Wonderwall\" with Indian classical musicians. He was interested in meeting local musicians. The Beatles use the sitars in their record. Somehow we were able to imagine The Beatles as our band, as an Indian band. And you know, India was a closed society and a closed economy, and it was a not very easy to get your hands on albums. In 1962 or very early '63 on the international shortwave, a group of people in Bangalore heard their music and said, \"Hey, wait a minute, this is very different.\" What it did really was to liberate an entire generation from the cultural shackles of the past. The British had left in 1947, this core was born in the late forties or early fifties, mid fifties. When they came of age, they rejected the past and embraced the new. In those days, most of the musicians were really from the Anglo Indian Catholic Christian community because they were the ones who were more trained in English. The Jets was really the first beat band, it wasn't so much rock music, but it was known as beat music. And the word beat was not far from Beatle. We started to model our lives along the lines of what The Beatles were doing at the time. The musicians those days were more into singing Jim Reeves, Everly Brothers, Pat Boone, and then bang came The Beatles. And it was like an electric breath of fresh air. Whatever we were used to suddenly lost its relevance. One day we just woke up and we saw an image of the great Shammi Kapoor with that Beatle wig in a Hindi film. That spoke about the enormous power and the clout of The Beatles. My mother was a Indian classical musician. And then she bought me my first 45, which was, \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand.\" Straight away and she bought me a British pop magazine where I could read about what was happening in the UK and the UK pop scene. One day one of my classmates came back to India after the holidays, and he brought an album by The Beatles, who we'd never heard of. By 10 o'clock that night, I'd fallen in love with the music, that I'd heard it three or four times, that music grew into me and I thought, \"Wow, this is fabulous.\" We used to play those records again and again and again, you know, somebody listening to the words, you know, somebody who's trying to figure out the chords- - Yes, the solo. - And the solos, and the most difficult part were the harmonies. Beatles still remain one of the greatest, you know, harmony groups, you know, ever. We went to Calcutta, we stayed with a friend. And the first night he took us to a restaurant called Trinkers. But when we walked in, we were dressed in our Beatle clothes, and everybody got up and started clapping. I don't know why, maybe they assumed we were some famous group but we weren't, but the owner of the restaurant said, \"Hey, you know, the people wanna know if you guys sing?\" I said, \"Yeah, we sing.\" He said, \"Would you do a couple of numbers?\" So we did, \"She Loves You\" and \"Please, Please Me.\" We brought the house down, shook our heads, et cetera, et cetera. The owner came and he said, \"Would you guys like a residency?\" And that's how our career started. We were the first Western music performing group to be ever recorded in India. At the HMV studios, and a song which, of I'm not mistaken, there was a song called \"Pain\" and \"The Girl Next Door.\" I think \"The Girl Next Door\" had some influences of The Beatles. Especially the harmonies. - Especially the harmonies. - The harmonies, yes, yes. I was planning to go west because, you know, forget the Indian culture, the Western culture was what we youngsters wanted. By some strange paradox, The Beatles, who lived in the culture I wanted, were making their way to India. LSD was really beginning to make its mark in London, in the the circles that they moved in. Some newspaperman came up and he said, \"Have you had LSD?\" So I thought, well, I'll either be cagey here or I'll be honest, so I said, yes. Oh God, well, I mean, the first time was when George and Me, John and Cynthia were invited for dinner by our dentist. And that was a bit scary, because, you know, what was happening to us. Do you know what I mean? It's just, everything is surreal. And you look at your hand and you're like 500 years old. And then I'd hear my voice and wonder where it came from. And colours, and there's an intensity to it. When we took the notorious wonder, drug LSD, we had it and we went out to a club and it was incredible. When I got onto acid, right, you know the day that you're at a hundred percent potential and you can handle whatever the situation is, with acid, or just after acid, the percent of good days as opposed to bad days was just a bit better, you know. They particularly got into drugs and Indian music at the same time, and it seemed like there was some kind of a connection between the two, there wasn't of course, because they both preexisted separately. There must be an intimate connection between Indian music and drugs, maybe because of the bizarre sound, and there should be a drug connection he said that- Just watch who you're calling bizarre, Dick. Yes, I have difficulty with the word bizarre. I meant B-A-Z-A-A-R, the other... No, wait a minute, there's no way I can get out of this. To Western ears, the unusual sound might suggest some sort of chemical intoxication. I'm not blaming George, but you know, somehow because of him, the sitar became really popular among the young people. The hippies were the ones who caught on to a new music, and it just happens that most of them were, you know, were smoking pot or something. And, since then, the two got caught up together but it's really a problem. Yeah, I requests to my listeners to be in a clear mind, because I like to put them, you know, - make them high with the music. - Yourself. Yes, and I feel rather cheated when they're already high. LSD opened them up to experiences and awarenesses of consciousness that they wouldn't have got in any other way. Eastern religion, I think, would have been opaque to them, they wouldn't have been able to understand it at all, but, having had that experience, suddenly these things made sense. George said that when he first took LSD, he heard voices in the back of his head saying yogis of the Himalayas. Maharishi, good evening. You once said even if only 1/10 of the adult population meditated for short periods each day, it would not take more than a few months to remove the entire accumulation of tension in the world. - These are your words? - I'm absolutely convinced about it. I saw an advertisement in the paper for transcendental meditation classes. So I went with a girlfriend. England I've been visiting once every year. People do feel stress and strain due to the greater undertaking in their life. Paul phoned George and said, \"There's this man called Maharishi who's going to come to England and talk about meditation\" And I said, \"Oh, that's the same guy that, you know, I follow\" So in those days, when one Beatle did something, they all did it, so we all went. Now you've been travelling the world now for many years. You've made, I think, something like eight world tours. Ninth, I returned this time. This was the ninth completed. Maharishi was the most powerful, magnetically charismatic person I've ever met. He was also the happiest person I ever met. He was filled with this energy that you wanted to be near him all the time. All of us who were on his staff, we fought each other to get into the room with him. It was just the right time, anyway, there we were waiting for someone- Waiting for a guru, - and he came. - The great magic man to come, and he came, you know. There he was, he's just talking about it all and he had great answers. 'Cause he's got that kind of thing, you know, and he got a twinkle in the eye. They told Maharishi that they'd been seeking a spiritual experience. They'd been trying to do it through drugs, but it just didn't work, you know? And so he invited them to come to Bangor, North Wales. Where he would be doing a meditation retreat for 10 days. The Beatles seem to be among your supporters now, how do you feel about that? They seem to be very intelligent and I'm honoured. And so you think that if The Beatles adopt your teaching, then they can spread it amongst other young people in England? And much more, not only England, but around the world. Because the word Beatle has gone on in all the continents, and younger people are fascinated by their name. What do you think of The Beatles? Very good, intelligent young boys, and there's great potential. And their music? Music I haven't heard, but because they are appreciated all over the world, they must have something very grateful in their music. I think he's trying to say is the things we're getting into aren't that important. Money has taken over from God. Instead of trying to get where God is, we all try and get the biggest bank balance. That's what it seems to mean. Peace of mind is like an ocean, very deep. And the activity's only on the surface like that. So if the waves of the ocean contact deeper level of water, then the wave becomes stronger. That means that we're going to be happier. And much happier and much more creative also. He was found in his second floor bedroom, just after two o'clock this afternoon by his housekeeper. Mr. Epstein has been unwell now for some months. And he's been in the habit of taking tablets to help him sleep at night. When Brian died, The Beatles clearly were lost. They were like jelly, their manager, their best friend, their man who they rely on totally for their fame, for their fortune, you know, their guide in life, was now gone. John, where would you be today without Mr. Epstein? I don't know. I understand that Mr. Epstein was to be initiated here? Mmm. When was he coming up? Was he coming up in the afternoon? Coming tomorrow. Just Monday, that's all we knew. I spoke to him Wednesday evening, then evening before we first saw Maharishi's lecture and he was in great spirits. I wanted Maharishi to bring him back to life again. You know, I, by this time, I'm giving him so much power and how extraordinary that they were with Maharishi, who's now going to be, sort of, their spiritual guru, but also that they could lean on him, because they trusted him so much. So, for that moment in time, he replaced Brian. I understand that the Maharishi conferred with you all? He told us not to get overwhelmed by grief, and whatever thoughts we have of Brian, to keep 'em happy, because any thoughts we have of him will travel to him, wherever he is. I come to India because of I want to leave material world. Come to a simple country. Ganga is a holy river because it comes from Himalayas and this place has much energy. And it come down, no? Takes energy and comes here. The ashrams or monasteries of the various religious orders glimmer over the smooth green water. Though the sun is hot, the river is icy, flowing from a glacier high up in the Himalayas, the land of the Gods. But Rishikesh, its name means place of the wise ones, is far from being a remote or desert region. Its one of the most celebrated centres of pilgrimage in the whole of India. In the cool clear air of Rishikesh, North India, the meditation retreat of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Flower-loving yogi told reporters that his brand of peace of mind could only be truly appreciated by intelligent men of the world with rewarding activities and high incomes. The purpose of life is the expansion of happiness. Anyone can find the way. That's the basic teaching of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Are The Beatles really going to find happiness here in Rishikesh? Are they really going to become, as Maharishi hopes, the practical philosophers of the age? Or must they return home unsatisfied? Eternal, rich, young men victims of a fad, looking for something, anything, to make their lives worth while. I was a reporter. I'd heard that the best thing that a reporter can do is to beat all the other reporters in getting to the news. A friend of mine read that The Beatles were coming to stay with the Maharishi. And he said, \"Saeed, do you know what it means? The whole world and its media is going to be here.\" The idea is to beat them. How do you beat them? \"Ah,\" I said, \"the idea is to become a disciple. If I become an insider, I'll get the story.\" So I walked in, you had to make some excuse if you're a drug addict, if you had failed, if you are a junkie, he whispered a mantra, a chant, in my ear, Which I'm not supposed to share with anybody. Then I went in, and again, and again, until all the sadhus who were going to be his managers recognise me. The password was jaguar will live, you said jaguar will live then you were in. From Hardwar, to Rishikesh, across Lakshman Jhula. I was taking aback. It was like a locust storm. Journalist, after journalist, after journalist, hundreds of them, \"What's going on? They're not letting us in.\" I said, \"They're not letting anybody in.\" Overnight, I went off to Rishikesh, with quite a few people from all over India. And it was very difficult to even know where The Beatles, where the ashram was, because it was so fortified. Fortified in the sense that, you know, there are a lot of police, there was a lot of bundobust in there. The whole day, we would just, early morning, wake up, somebody said, \"Hey, The Beatles are coming to the Ganga.\" And so we'd all rush up there and wait there for two, three hours, but nothing would happen, you know. But it was like a celebration, it was like an exhibition, 'cause, you know, there was so much of joy. One day, Maharishi called me in and he said, \"The Beatles are gonna be arriving in a few days, but I want you to go fix up their rooms.\" They put me in charge to make their rooms nicer. I would have them paint this, they'd drop so much paint on the floor, then they'd have to paint the floor. Anyway, we had curtains put up. We had mirrors, we even had toilet fixtures that worked. They have mattresses on their beds. There's a fan club of real beetles waiting to welcome them, but the hardest thing about the life they lead here are the beds they'll sleep on. A hard wooden base, a simple, rather than a spartan existence. When they did arrive he introduced them to me and said to them, \"If you want to anything, get a hold of Nancy. Nancy will be my ears and eyes in case you need anything, you let me know through her.\" So I found my way and I went to the gate and I said, \"Jaguar will live.\" \"Ah,\" they said. Oh, there was a hell of commotion outside. \"How did this bastard get in?\" I said, \"I'm just a devotee of the Maharishi\" So anyway, I entered and there under the tree, Maharishi, George, John Lennon, Paul, their respective ladies, a whole galaxy. I mean, I can't keep describing them. I need a photograph. So I called the sadhus. I said, \"Look, I'm having difficulty managing this on my own, I immediately assumed the role of publicity manager for the Maharishi.\" So I said, \"Here's a name, Raghu Rai. You go outside, call him in. This man came, who was from the ashram, and he says, \"Mr. Naqvi wants to see you.\" I said, \"Give me two minutes.\" So I went in, I put a big zoom lens on my camera and put it inside my labaada. So when I'm walking nobody can see if I'm carrying a camera. So I walked with him for about eight, 10 minutes. One sadhu was standing there. So he was standing next to him, so Saeed said, \"Look there.\" I was shocked. Then I turned around and I saw that guy sadhu standing next to us. And I said. So he goes to get a glass of water for me, and Saeed says, \"Hurry up, hurry up.\" In those days, we didn't have auto focus, auto exposure cameras, so you had to set the focus set and the exposure, everything. And I take just one picture, nicely focused and proper. Under the tree, Maharishi Yogi and The Beatles. See this building, this is the building where they lived. This room, I'll show you this side, this is the room of John Lennon. John Lennon stayed here. Other Beatles were staying in these rooms, along with their wives and family. So when Beatles came, I was a little kid. We were enjoying the whole atmosphere and the jungles and Beatles and the Maharishi, we were very close. We never find he's a celebrity, or some big thing, we should not go near him. So this was the place where Maharishi used to converse with Beatles and guests. Straight we can see River Ganga, clear water and forest. There was a raised platform, rectangular shape. It was used for posing with the visitors and Beatles for the group photographs. Maharishi's disciples can wander in peace amongst the trees and bungalows, or meditate in some quiet spot overlooking the Ganges. He doesn't require you to give anything up except drugs and a week's salary, in The Beatles case around 11,000 pounds a piece. What exactly have you been doing, how do you meditate? You sit down, you relax, and then you repeat a sound to yourself, and it sounds daft, but it's just a system of relaxation and that's all it is, and there's nothing more to it. By expanding the conscious capacity of the mind, mental capacity will be stronger, thought power will be great, and when the thought power great, then the thought will find their fulfilment more easily. You go into do those interstellar spaces, where the spaces ultimately shrink into your being. Now, this gibberish goes on and on and on relentlessly, and you have these people close their eyes. And the more unintelligible it gets, the more profoundly affected they pretend to be. Because, I can't really imagine anyone being moved by words which are patently and absolutely absurd. His lectures were in the nature of this kind of arcane nonsense. Nothing succeeds like success, and it succeeded. Are you a business man? I don't deal with money directly, but I'm conducting the movement in 50 countries. I can't be said to be no businessman, even though I'm not dealing with money. I was a young girl, 21 or 22, so there I was in this beautiful ashram, I was taken to meet the Maharishi. He asked me to come close to him, I did, too close in fact. He said, I'm going to whisper something in your ear, the mantra, then he said, \"I want you to go down into my prayer room, and I want you to concentrate upon that mantra You're going to feel like a new person.\" And I actually believed that this was going to happen to me. It was a dark room and there was some incense burning and there was some things hanging on the wall. And I started repeating the mantra. I repeated it, and the only feeling that I remember there was this intense desire to escape from that place. I went near the Maharishi and he said, \"How do you feel my daughter? Do you feel like a different person?\" I said, \"Actually I don't.\" He looked at me and he said, \"I going to whisper another mantra.\" \"Back you go, repeat that mantra. You might have to spend a little longer.\" By now, I was in control. I repeated the mantra, and within half an hour I came upstairs. I gave him a glorious account of how I felt like a totally new human being. I felt like a different person all together. That was the only way to escape. And I walked out into freedom. Maharishi really influenced The Beatles songs and lyrics tremendously, starting with \"Across The Universe\" which is written right after The Beatles learned meditation. In that song, it says \"jai guru deva,\" and Maharishi used to use that expression all the time. Now once more. It is in praise of the guru. So John Lennon put that into the song, jai guru deva. And then he said, \"om,\" and om is the primordial sound that underlies and gives rise to the universe. Just the exposure to mantras, I mean, the idea was a repetitious sound could create an altered state of consciousness and you get it in, \"Hello, Goodbye,\" you get in goo goo g'joob. Repetitious sounds creeping into their songs, whether deliberately or not. I lived for three days in a cottage at a camp in Rishikesh, just a hundred yards from The Beatles. I remember sitting around a bonfire at night with The Beatles, and Mike Love of The Beach Boys, And Donovan, and others singing and playing the guitar. It was a cold, cold evening, and at some point I muttered to the person next to me, \"I'm freezing.\" A man seated just ahead of me, wrapped in a huge brown grey blanket heard me. He said, \"Move up, love, come and share my blanket with me.\" It was George Harrison. I should have said yes, but by then I had successfully cultivated an air of nonchalance and looked at George like he was a nobody and replied, \"No, thanks, George, I'm fine.\" Four regrettable words that I could never take back, and that have haunted me all my life for what could have been, but never was. The person who was actually sincere about meditation, about Indian culture, Indian music was George Harrison. Maharishi said of all The Beatles, George is the most advanced, and this is his last life. George wanted to understand why he was chosen to be famous. He found curious that he, a boy from Liverpool who otherwise would have had a very menial job, was selected and was famous. And he wants to know the answer. Really the only reason to be living is to have complete full knowledge, full bliss consciousness. Everything else is just mundane and secondary. The purpose is to transcend from this relative state of consciousness to an absolute state of consciousness. Maharishi said, John Lennon has many more lives to go, and he must not give into his weakness for women, or it will ruin him. Keeping company with himself, it could be part of the treatment, John stalked along the shady paths. John Lennon when he first arrived, he was grey, he'd been heavily into drugs, he just looked awful. And then little by little, you saw the change that came over this man, he had pink cheeks, he started to be very sociable, he was out playing his guitar, chatting with other people, and he was having such a lovely time. Meditation worked all right, you know, you can handle each day better than I could handle it before. I was mediating 8 hours a day and things like that. And it was really some trip, like acid was nowhere. Just sitting there just muttering some word in a room, that's the biggest trip I've ever had in life. Ringo is always in meditation, and he goes by feeling and heart. Whereas the other Beatles too much brain is in the way. Ringo enjoyed a peace of togetherness with Mrs. Ringo, it was a very peaceful scene. Ringo Starr, two or three days, he sees all this and he declares, \"It's like a Butlin holiday camp,\" and disappears, he left. And then there were three. Ringo and his wife, Maureen, stayed at the ashram for 10 days. Ringo's allergies cause problems with the ashram food. He was allergic to so many things that he took two suitcases to India. One had his clothes and the other one was stuffed with cans of Heinz beans. But the primary reason that Ringo and Maureen left is because they missed their kids. Maharishi, I thank him, you know, all the time I thank him for giving me what it gave me. So I'm glad I've got it in case I ever wanna go into it again, you know, you can't lose, if you learn something. Maharishi wanted to take them off on a trip to the Himalayas. A company, Ganja's Helicopter Services. I'd always wanted to become a pilot. I became the chief pilot for the Maharishi. And I flew everybody, including the prime minister, and Mahatma Gandhi also, and The Beatles. Paul kept on saying, \"Me, me, me,\" because he wanted to get in. And John said, \"No, me, me, me.\" And anyway, finally, John just pushed him aside and went in. I'm flying John on my left and the Maharishi on my right. And the Maharishi lent across me, as you know, he had a lot of hair and beard, it was difficult for me to fly the helicopter. He was telling John down there in the mountains, people lived there, they never went down to the valleys, and they're praying all the time. So John said, \"What are they're praying for?\" So the Maharishi said \"They are praying that we crash.\" And John said, \"Goodness, why do they want us to crash?\" They said, \"Well, they're on the mountaintop with hardly any food. And I'm in Rishikesh with all the celebrities there, and all the money in the world.\" So John said, \"Maharishi, if you don't move your head and hair their prayers will be answered.\" And of course, I started laughing and everybody did. He had a sense of humour. They were visiting Dehradun, George, John, and Paul. He said this Saturday, they're having celebration in the ashram to celebrate the birth of George Harrison wife. If I could could bring some other musicians along with me, they'll be very happy. So I said, I told them, \"Okay, I can arrange it.\" So we all sat down, Maharishi gave us a lecture, and then I was asked to play. There was a composition with George Harrison, \"With In, Without You,\" which was based on Dhrag Jhug, so I decided to play that. And then George was excited about it. And I smiled at him, he smiled and he waved at me. At that time, Nick sang with me, and Nick was just a visiting teacher. Now tell me where did that famous photo of us? Was it in the middle or was it over here? Here? Okay. - In this area, in this wall. - Okay. I have such vivid memories of that birthday party where so much music was played, so much glamour. Pattie Harrison there in her mauve sari. Part of our mission was to bring her George Harrison's birthday present to her, the dilruba. It was so relaxed coming from Britain. The Beatles were impossible to see or touch or reach, and here it was a completely different atmosphere. They were absolutely natural, all the musicians there. I think I spoke to Donovan, Mike Love, Paul Horn, and of course, Paul McCartney, Jane Asher, John Lennon, I don't think I spoke to George Harrison because he was so tied up in both the occasion of his wife's birthday and also the music. He really was playing music and enjoying music and absorbing Indian music. There was no pretence about it. He was completely hooked. The music started off being very Indian and played on Indian instruments, but then you could say it deteriorated into a birthday party with the \"Happy Birthday\" song, and the British national anthem for some curious reason. As the evening went on and perhaps people got a bit fidgety, we went outside and enjoyed fireworks. Of course, I went away feeling that perhaps the meditation was all a bit of a lark, because they enjoyed themselves so much in the evening. George Harrison was thinking mostly of playing better, serious music, which belonged to the world. But John Lennon was a serious human being. He was not very talkative, but he's thinking was very beautiful. So I was slightly more fascinated by John. I think they gave me so much respect, you know. They treated me very well, they called me, sir. And I was feeling strange, you know. I told them, \"Don't call me, sir, no no no.\" They could not have seen me at all, there was no need for what they did. Success had not gone to the head, you know. They were simple human beings. We came up the path here, we were killing time and The Beatles meantime had come back to their bungalow and they were on the roof, not just The Beatles, but many of the musicians were on the roof of the bungalow playing music. And it's the most memorable thing of my day here, was hearing this music, which was of course unrecorded music, it was just being created at that time. And we felt we were in the, you know, witnessing the first time round, the first version of this music. The word was coming to the Maharishi that they had suspended their meditations and that they were sitting and composing music and things. We were there for about six weeks, and during that time was no pressure from the outside world. There was no pressure of them being Beatles, and their creative juices just overflowed. They wrote all the songs from \"The White Album.\" They worked out gradually what they wanted us to do for the rest of their time as Beatles. Other than when they're we in the studio, they didn't get to spend a lot of time together So in India, they were suddenly together like sort of mates again. So they could sit out and play in the way that John and Paul used to play in the council house where Paul had grown up. And you've got Mike Love from The Beach Boys is there so they've got that whole tributary of American music that had influenced them, and Donovan with this kind of folk tradition and Paul Horn, who was a jazz flautist, he was there too, so you've got a lot of interesting, sort of, streams coming in. I'll show you the stairs here. They'd sit here on these stairs. There here was bamboo structure here, as a fence, those days. They'd come and they'd make new song there, staying here, sitting on the stairs. And that side, Prudence were living, Maharishi told her to be inside, stay with their practises. Mia Farrow's sister Prudence way ahead of anybody else. As soon as she entered her thing, she went into meditation and she has not emerged, it's already 24 hours. So she's serious. They would invite her outside. \"Hello, Prudence, come out, come out, Prudence.\" And she won't come. And then they made a song, \"Dear Prudence.\" I think one that's kind of interesting is when I came back from a tiger hunt with my eldest son, when we came walking in, he said to Maharishi, \"I shot a tiger today, is that bad karma?\" Sitting there observing this was John Lennon, and John said, \"Don't you call that slightly life destructive?\" And I said, \"It was the tiger or us.\" Maharishi glared at Nancy the whole time they were talking about it. Life destruction is life destruction, end of story. That's how the song, \"The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill\" originated. It was John's answer to Nancy's paltry excuse. Because Mike Love was there and they knew The Beach Boys music, it was this kind of friendly rivalry of them wanting to top each other. But \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" Is just like a parody of a Beach Boys song, but instead of being about the USA, it's about Russia, and it was a very novel idea at the time to think of a rock and roll song that appeared to be celebrating Russian culture and had all these Russian names and Russian places being mentioned. Opposition members today demanded in inquiry into Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Alleging that Rishikesh have become a centre of conspirage. The issue was raised by Mr. K. Anirudhan after a radio transmitter was found on a bus near the antibiotics factory in Rishikesh belonging to a foreigner. The furor broke out in parliament. It was led by the communist, backed by the socialists, and they said that there was a CIA camp in the ashram, and the Maharishi were getting all these foreigners, including The Beatles, to destabilise India. I give the CIA total credit for sponsoring and initiating the entire consciousness movement, counterculture events of the 1960s. This was exactly the time when Indira Gandhi was making friends with the Soviet Union. Today we're going to show you a cases of attempted espionage by agents of the Sino-Soviet Intelligence System. If you recognise the way a Sino or Soviet agent operates, both in finding someone vulnerable to subversion, as well as in their technique of ensnaring him and applying pressure to get him to play ball. The KGB sent their top man in India, Bezmenov, to the ashram to check out the Maharishi. My function was to discover what kind of people attend this school. Yes, there are some influential opinion makers who come back with the crazy stories about Indian philosophy. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a great spiritual leader, or maybe a great charlatan and crook, depending from which side you're looking at him. Beatles were trained at his ashram, Mia Farrow, and other useful idiots from Hollywood visited his school, and they returned back to the United States, absolutely zonked out of their minds with marijuana, hashish and crazy ideas of meditation. Maharishi used to always say, \"You can never create peace through signing treaties, through legislation, through any kind of external means. The only way to create world peace is for people to meditate.\" See, if you carefully look at what Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is teaching, is that most of the problems, most of the burning issues of today, can be solved simply by meditating. Don't rock the boat, don't get involved, just sit down, look at your navel and meditate, and things, due to some strange logic, due to cosmic vibration will settle down by themselves. The single aim of spiritually regenerating every man everywhere in the world, and creating peace. You can get control of yourself just by sitting quietly, and by turning off from the external problems we have, and all this society, you can go inside yourself where it's always calm and peaceful. This is exactly what the KGB and Marxist Lenin's propaganda want, to distract their attention and mental energy from real issues into non-issues, into non-existent harmony. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi obviously is not on the payroll of the KGB, but whether he knows it or not, he contributes greatly to demoralisation of American society. Paul McCartney and his girlfriend, Jane Asher, stayed for five weeks and they left because Jane had a theatrical commitment back in London. This presumably is your first big meditation, and what effect has it had on you? I think it calms you down. It's hard to tell because it was so different life out there. It'd be easy to tell now that I'm back and we're doing some ordinary thing to see just what it does. They were four working class guys from Liverpool. They had an innate sense of not being taken advantage of. So when they get together with Maharishi, Maharishi is inevitably tempted to capitalise on his sudden worldwide fame because of The Beatles association. They realise that maybe Maharishi had been using them all along for publicity, ever since the final record, that was \"by The Beatles Spiritual Teacher,\" it said on the album. So John and George started a think something fishy is here. He's using us for publicity. So they began to hear little bits of news here and there, from the grapevine of, you know, your Maharishi's planning this and planning that, and you're gonna be in it and they're going, \"Are we?\" Maharishi kept promising ABC that he would do a special with The Beatles. And The Beatles kept saying, \"We're not gonna do this special,\" but Maharishi kept promising it over and over. There comes a time in late '67, when Paul and George go to Sweden, basically to tell the Maharishi to cool a bit, you know. \"Don't start making plans that involve us without telling us first.\" We're glad to have you here. - Thank you. - Thank you. We do appreciate your music and... That's a posy, yes? The smell of the flowers. We only decided to come yesterday, just to pop over to have a little chat. Yes, yes. And when The Beatles were in Rishikesh, he, without their knowledge was having the discussions with a Hollywood film company called Four Star International. Maharishi promised them that they could have exclusive rights to make a film about Maharishi and about Maharishi's guru. But unfortunately, Maharishi made the same promise to someone else. He had given rights to Four Star Productions. The lawyer arrived in Rishikesh with a signed contract. They gave exclusive rights to film Maharishi for the next five years. Some suits arrive from Hollywood and a crew, and John and George were going, \"We didn't want this, you know we are here to meditate, we don't want these film people here.\" And there was a confrontation with Maharishi about, \"Why you're doing this, we told you not to\" In any case, The Beatles became quite disillusioned about that. The film was really kind of a deal breaker, and they got very angry because they had been granted exclusive rights to do this film, and now another film company is there. So the whole thing just fell apart. I don't know what happened, I still don't know. But I know there many rumours around, but John said, \"That's it we're, we're going, were going.\" But I know John wants to come back to England and see Yoko, and so any little excuse and John was ready to go, 'cause we'd been there for weeks. Well, it was only John who was upset. John dragged George along. And I still think it was when Magic Alex came from the Apple Corps group. Alexis Margas was one of The Beatles associates. In fact, he was very close to John, and sort of attached himself to John's hip, and Cynthia really didn't like Alexis. She was very concerned about this Svengali influence that he was having on John. John had introduced Alex as, \"My new guru.\" He was this electronics marvel. Supposedly, he introduced himself as somebody who is like Edison and Marconi combined, but in fact, he was just a TV repairman. He's just a friend of ours who's in electronics. Oh yeah. He's called Alex, and he's great, he's a Greek fella. -And he's invented things- -You know he's Greek. He's invented incredible things. He was a minx, yeah, naughty, little boy. You see, he wanted to have power over John, so he would, you know, create all these things, pretending he's a scientist. He said, \"Oh, here's this one from new wallpaper, but it's all speakers, so the whole room will have this one big speaker.\" So he loved all that, controlling John. So clearly and obviously Maharishi was in the way. One night, John and Maharishi were having this wonderful rapport, and I, you know how you can see sometimes when a person let's the mask drop from their face, and I could see this really dislike of Maharishi on Magic Alex's face. It disturbed me and I felt something was going wrong. No one ever saw him meditating. And as a matter of fact, he admitted that he came to India for the purpose of getting The Beatles away from Maharishi. Alexis said, \"Oh, it's because we don't want Maharishi to have that much influence over the boys.\" I'm totally convinced that Magic Alex made a friend of one of the young women at the ashram, and he got her to tell John Lennon that she was having sex with Maharishi. Is this just horrified all of us when this whole thing happened. I believe that Maharishi made a pass. And the reason I believe it is because he made a pass at many women that I knew. Wasn't the first or the last one. Well I remember Maharishi saying that, you know, \"If you haven't an ugly woman over here, and a beautiful woman over there, it's just easier for your attention to go to the more beautiful.\" John and George didn't believe it at first, but finally Alexis convinced them and then went and got taxis for all of them before they could change their mind. While they were waiting for the taxis, John wrote, \"Maharishi, Maharishi, what have you done? You made a fool of everyone.\" The song had a lot of expletives in it, and George said, \"You can't say that, that's ridiculous\" So John changed the lyrics to \"Sexy Sadie.\" Yeah, \"Sexy Sadie,\" it was actually called \"Maharishi.\" And it was a put down in the Maharishi in very vicious terms. I don't think the chance of it getting out with the words that John had originally, but basically denounces him and says he was a bit of a rogue. John dragged George along and then he just bolted from the ashram. I think Maharishi was a mistake. What do you mean he was a mistake? We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was, you know, but he's human, and for a while we thought he wasn't, you know, thought he was a. The Beatles, they were opening us up to different experiences in various ways, you know. Indian philosophy and Indian music. And then when they went to Rishikesh, you know, it was the idea of Indian travel. It's like, \"Wow, looks nice over there, you know, they're enjoying themselves in the sunshine.\" There'd been a hippie trail, an embryonic hippie trail, in the early sixties, a few people had gone out. The whole point being that you drove over land, the ultimate destination was in fact Katmandu in Nepal. I'm sure The Beatles inspired lots of people to go, because this little trickle of people on the hippie trail beforehand suddenly turned into a flood. Did you enjoy the trip over to India? Yes, The journey was terrible, but the trip was all right. There was a report that we get -we got a very bad report- -Yeah its true, we smashed him. You didn't like him, or you didn't have the patience and decided to go home. We were there four month so, George and I were. Did you think this man was on the level? I don't know what level he's on, but we had a nice holiday in India and came back and rested. Maharishi looked visibly frail and without his usual effervescence. His brilliant and beautiful yogic radiance was reduced to grey and to ashen. He became physically sick when the chorus moved from Rishikesh to Kashmir. He's still a nice fella, and everybody's fine, but we don't go out with him anymore. When the Rishikesh experience finished, Paul, John and Ringo just kind of carried on, resumed with their lives, but for George, India was never a five minute thing. India was a lifetime devotion. And he wasn't just gonna give it up because of the way that Rishikesh finished with a bit of a sour taste. India for him was something that he continued to push. George didn't want to go back to London. George was still in meditation mode, and he didn't want to go straight back to see the press. So he said, \"Let's go down to Kerala, just for a week.\" And it was very calm then, and then, you know, he wanted to slowly come back into the business life, as it were, in London, slowly, in his way. I mean, because everybody, all of a sudden became an individual. John, Paul, Ringo and George. The Maharishi phase faded out, you know, but the Indian aesthetics and the etiquettes remained with everybody. Using the influence of Indian music and the culture. You know, when you look back at The Beatles story on their return to the UK in the spring of 1968, there was still the comradery that saw them through the madness of Beatlemania. Soon to dissolve as the fraught sessions of \"The White Album\" began. Working separately most of the time and not as a unit, and with Ringo quitting the band for a short period, remarkably, they delivered what many would call one of their greatest albums. When The Beatles were in India, Maharishi told them, if they don't continue meditating regularly their band would break up. Now, does this mean a business or emotional split within The Beatles? I should think a bit of both. It's probably to do with growing up and to do with there was a time when there were just four of them but now they're married and there are children. I was born in 1971. Same time around when Beatles broke up. I mean, even like, I guess it's about 50 odd years or something, it still sounds fresh. It sounds amazing. The world would have been like, so shit without them, you know? The world is so much better to live in with that music around. The songs that they made in India, in Rishikesh, I had no idea and out of them some of the songs like \"Blackbird,\" like \"Dear Prudence,\" like these are some of the songs that I used to perform in my old band in Chennai. To have known that they have written these songs in India, it just gave it so much more meaning because I used to connect to these songs as a classical musician, more than a person who loves English music. I was born in '74, so for me to get to know The Beatles happened much later. We were not really born at the time when the dressing, how a Beatles haircut or the dress that they wore really attracted us, I mean, we didn't see that. We only heard the music. It's purely the music. It sounded very simple, very catchy, and you could, you know, have a high recall. So whenever you heard a song, you would remember it. But when you sat down to work on it, to try and see if you can sing that song, that is when you realise the complexity of it. I don't know how it was appreciated when it was released, but it's something that is still relevant today. They came to see, in the fullness of time, in particular, in George's case, George discovered from gathering evidence what exactly happened at the end of their stay in Rishikesh, and how Alexis Margas, Magic Alex had cooked up this whole thing. George always loved Maharishi, and toward the end of his life he went back to see Maharishi. George said to Maharishi, \"I came to apologise\" and Maharishi asked \"For what?\" And George replied, \"You know, for what.\" Maharishi apparently said to George, he believed that The Beatles were angels on earth and that they were not guilty of any crime themselves. So when George came away from that meeting, he felt cleansed of his guilt of the method of their departure back in 1968. I got into India, I think that was the one thing in my life that I could have done without everything else, but that one thing of getting in touch with what's inside through Maharishi and Ravi Shankar and indie music. And as for the others, well they all warmed again to the culture and the spirituality of India. The only way we can change the system is by changing it non-violently, because they've done the violent for millions of years. I think the only way to do it is Gandhi's way, and that's nonviolent, passive, positive, or whatever they call it these days. John Lennon spoke kindly of Maharishi in other interviews. Ringo and Paul have both said the same, everything became okay again, in the end. Years ago, we studied meditation with the Maharishi. He was one of the ones that wasn't a fake. There were a lot of them around that time who were into Rolls Royces and chicks. He wasn't one of them. I actually met him quite recently. He lives in the Netherlands now, and I took Stella, my daughter and James, my son with me. And he is a spry old codger, he in his eighties and he's still working, he's still going. The day when Maharishi died, there was a big storm. The water from the river Ganges came whirling up and it showered in this area. The local folks who came here to pay their tributes to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi were amazed to see this supernatural thing. It was a power of Maharishi which brought Gunga on this top of mountain. When I first came here 10 years ago, this was just jungle, ruins and jungle. And we would sneak in through the back, there were cracks in the wall, and you would smoke pot and see leopards at night. This is what people did. So I take tourists into the ashram, I show them everything, and I'm trying to bring them back into 1968 and give them some of the experience of The Beatles here. Tourists that come here, they really appreciate it. They really appreciate to have the sense for The Beatles as a historical entity. My experience when I went to The Beatles ashram was super magical. These huge superstars, you wouldn't really think that they'd go to a really simple, no-frills ashram in Rishikesh. The most exciting thing about music is the way that it has the capacity to shift cultural norms and expand people's minds, and in India, that's exactly what The Beatles did by bridging the gap between East and West in a country that was very much under this, you know, dark cloud of colonial rule. Which in many ways created a culture of apology for being Indian and a reverence for whatever was foreign. That what was so powerful is for the most powerful band in the world to come and revere our culture. They had descended in our part of the country, and they had embraced the spiritual narrative of India, and they had come to Rishikesh, and there were images of them with Mahesh Yogi and then suddenly we look, they are one of us. As kids, as Indian kids, you know, we're always rebelling against our culture. And then you realise that like something that is so influential in pop culture, took a lot of influence from India. My introduction to them was I happened to be part of the age of illegal downloading, at the time of like Napster and stuff. We used to have \"The White Album\" on CD. That was my first introduction to The Beatles. We still felt it's influence even though we were born like in the eighties and nineties. India is considered this place where you could go for a spiritual awakening, for meditation, so I think The Beatles came to India to look for that. And in some ways they really did find that. I guess that's a small gift that India gave the world through The Beatles. The happiest time in life, one of the happiest times was in India. I mean, it was just such a groove. And it was such a pure thing, everything is slightly more in perspective. The whole of life should be a spiritual experience because we are spirits who are just encased in bodies. People forget that and think they're just this body, but we're actually spirits in bodies.\n"

No. You will look. Watch. [moving music] [sword voice] If you're the type that girls approve of, you're looked after. Do you see these ladies? Gently touch their hands in turn, first with the outside of your hand. Girls will be curious about the person touching you and look at you. Of course, the main girl too. Now it's all up to a sincere call. Naber? [sword voice] Understood. [sword voice] [sword voice] Sorry guys. -What's up, Merve, the president. -What are you doing? You humiliate me in front of my friends. Do you have these friends of yours? Do you hear what comes out of your mouth? She hears, Merve, she hears. But let the whole school hear that? Sound, test, one, two. Merve, if you have a new boyfriend, I'm... [# Figaro opera #] [laugh] Wow, you're a man of your word, Amazon girl. Cut short pole. He will say, then to his married house, to his peasant village. We're finally alone. Let me enjoy. You are so beautiful that one can sing songs. Look at me, you're curling so beautifully too people come to you to dress in a skirt. You would love this, wouldn't you? Ok. Here is your opportunity. Some kind of claim. One on one basketball game. The winner wears the skirt. Look at me I don't know how I look from there but I'm still not crazy enough to go to a basketball game with the captain of the basketball team. Your two counts against my ten count. [dubstep music] You say. Agreed. Out on the field. But if our people hear it, I won't get involved. Shhh. What are you doing here son? I haven't done anything. What are you doing? What should I do, I was with the principal. This time he compared me to a brainless sea cucumber clinging to the hand of the person holding it. Thanks. Ya... I'm not feeling well today. You have something since morning. What are you looking at and going crazy, my son is there. No problem bro. I'm going home, you can tell our kids. Demek Bade he? I know people like you well. You think you are something. You enter the life of anyone you wish by waving your hand, you deserve this too. Those are expensive words, Amazon girl. Let's see if your wrist is as strong as your chin. One left. I hope you in your skirt aren't as bad as your basketball. Of! Sırık! [game end bell] No congratulations? Come slow lord of the poles. Did your head, which was entrusted to you because you beat the girl until tomorrow, reached the sky? Did you think I wouldn't beat you just because you're the girl I fell in love with? Besides, I couldn't miss seeing you in a skirt. Tomorrow is the first day of your princess. Now you are burned, Yaprak Ayvaz. [sighs] So the whole school wears it. How bad could it be? There was really no way I could wear those two spans. Let's see what will come out of it? Yuh, what is this? Anne! You won't feel anything, my beautiful girl, trust me. Deep breath. So that's the wax that girls get so much trouble with on the toilet. This much. Yes, what did we say? Atomic physics, which studies the structure and properties of the atom at the same time, in the structure of substances formed by molecules... [knock on door] -Come. Sir, can I come in? Ayvaz, go ahead, my daughter. [students shouts of surprise] Don't look. Don't look! Get back, you beast. Sorry ma'am, what did you do to Yaprak? I'm gonna have to update my whole point system because of you dude. Don't keep embarrassing the girl. We made a bet with that pole. One on one basketball game or something. You with the captain of the basketball team... I lost. Merve is over, you started. Put on those pants because you're going to murder the man. Karademir no? Are you going to show us the size of an average atom? [laughter] This guy won't be able to get rid of me this time. Uh. No fight. We will shoot him with his own gun. What is in your mind? If they're basketball players... Don't make the man sick Oguz, focus on the game. Ali bird, the power of those basketball babies is not enough for us. Calm down a bit. We will beat them in such a way that they will sue us for sexual abuse. Youth. Who are these types? The bastard brought the school football team. Weren't they regional champions? I don't play against them. Look, Real Madrid vs. Yenimahalle coffee team. There is Gökhan Karademir, there is no panic. Gather. Here's the tactic. Everyone will win this match, even at the cost of their own life. Exactly. Come on! [moving music] [moving music] Are you ready for your punishment and my reward, Amazon girl? I'm waiting for a kiss from you right here. The pole really deserved a kiss this time. But not from me. Come on, Amazon girl, how long are you going to wait? It'll be worth the wait. Let's get you some chocolate milk. These cattle even found the stash in the crisper and blew it up. Dude says let's be more human. Counting our bites? We were not going to eat it without defrosting those winter coats. Right now, I have stalactites in my sensitive parts. Anyway, gentlemen, let's not be unresponsive to the list. Now we have frozen pizza and stuff like that. You also have human foods such as vegetables and fruits. Chips are also in Gökhan. Where is Gokhan? Merve, I have only one request from you. That hairy arm in the photo you shared Say it belongs to the mutated Kübra. Ok. Hi. I'm bad. I am Gökhan's friend. -Where is he? -I wonder where? -I'm Sinan. -You are Ali, right? Party? No, it's our usual shopping. How would you like me to join you tonight? I do not think so. See you later. It is not said in a fight. I don't understand, but Gökhan told me... Merve, I'm so sorry, I love you so much. There was probably a misunderstanding. Sorry. Now I understand why they called you the ice prince at school. It may be so for them, but... ... in my world ... ...there is no ice that will not melt at a hot enough temperature. [tearing music] Have fun for now. Ice prince. Legendary man. In honor of. What the hell is that? The girl officially brewed cold tea on her chin. Dude, you rejected a perfect nine. I think you should crash right now. Don't take it too long so I won't hit you now. Find Gökhan as soon as possible and bring him home. Take that butter from my hand so that it doesn't melt from my fire, Ali ice. Don't be silly, pass the eggs. Do you see? Involuntarily, they were boiled in my hand, Ali ice. I forbid the word ice in this house until further notice. But Ali is ice. Or I'll wring your little hands holding those eggs. I lost my mind that I would never see that dimple again. White man down. White man down. So you from me... Bad. Wow. May Mecnun Gökhan not reunite with his Merve. But Ali, the captain can get his wish. Love has won again. Ne Bade'si lan? It's a leaf. We are originally Georgian immigrants. Guys, give a hand and let's get this in a shower. I run away. My mother mentioned it, my grandmother came. -Did Nunu come? Say hi a lot. -I won't tell in life. -I'll come with you. -Gentlemen, shower? Brother, where are you going? Are you angry? Are you kidding me? I'm foaming. The man threw up on me. After that, he comes home like this and finds himself in the garbage in the morning. So you're not angry that I made fun of Bade. -What does that have to do with anything? -You look great with Bade. -That's okay. -How much is a flute, son? Leaf, you should just come out. -What are you trying to imply to me? -Okay, calm down, Ali bird. You may have fallen in love with Bade, but I... ... I expected you to be honest with me. Are you talking about honesty? It was as if I was the one who hid the fact that I met and argued with that boy. Okay, you want honesty? Then answer me honestly. Are you interested in Barış? To the pole? Let asteroid rain fall in your mouth. Thanks. I'm not in love with Bade either. Now extend your hand. Used, used. From now on the heart of either of us if it crashes for someone else, the other one will know first. Deal? I hope I get along well with your future girlfriend. Because you are too good a friend to be lost. Oh, your heart is beating so fast. I got a little tired while carrying Gökhan. Crack crack crack! Fondip! Okay, okay, my queen, I heard. Come on, drive carefully, okay. My parents are on their way. They'll be back tomorrow night. Ali said to my son that I also left wraps in the closet, so that he can eat something in his stomach. -Oh, my aunt, dear. -Hey can. Any news from Gökkuş? Stomach-washed beef. But don't worry about the situation. Don't get lost anywhere. Crying girls were Ali's weakness. Whenever he helps a sad girl He felt closer to his lost sister. This is exactly what's happening right now. I guess. Can I sit? Our pole room is upstairs. Peace. Peace. What an honor to hear my name from your mouth, Amazon girl. Don't slow down now. I felt a little bad. Is it for me or... Are you aware? I can't even talk to you when Ali can be with whoever he wants. And what are you talking about, lord of the poles? I say selfishly Amazon girl, selfishly. -What are you doing here? -Did you understand? Look, let's agree on one thing. If I'm staying calm, it's because Leaf loves you. But don't take your chances at every opportunity. -It won't be good for you. -What happens if I try? Ali stop, calm down. I let it sit. It confused you, didn't it? OK, fine. You like pretensions, don't you? Let's figure it out, then. -Make a bet with me too. -Not necessary. It's between us. You choose the claim and the reward. Thanks. Ok. Then if Leaf doesn't get ninety on his next physics exam Get the hell out of this girl's life. Alright. But if I win, I want an apology from you. apology? I didn't know I hurt you so much. Just a minute. Did you just make a bet on me? While I'm here, without asking me. Leaf. I thought, good idea. And I will understand what it means to whom. Wherever you're making your bet. We're gonna get you a real girl today, okay? I ate his wife and daughter. It's been two hours since I ordered pizza. Forget the pizza now. You can't spend your life waiting for Kate Upton to pose. Watch. [sword voice] Sir? Do we know each other? I'm sure you said my name. Your voice was in my head. Am I reading your thoughts? That's incredible. Please let me try something. Say and tell him to keep a number from 1 to 10. Seven. The trick is, when you say 1 to 10... ... at the point where you snap your finger. Subconscious. What's up, Sinan? Ece? I see that you have also met Yasemin. Yasemin is my brother. It's good to see you move on with your life. But I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't choose your prey from my girlfriends. Well, you Ece, do you miss us? You know the answer to that, Sinan. I'm better, if that's the problem. -Sinan. -What? -You're strangling my friend. -What? There couldn't have been a better timing. [beep, alarm sound] [ring tone] Exactly. The winner of the day was Oğuz. Sit on the board or. Take it easy. Neuron wars. [phone ring] Leave that phone open. I lied to you. We didn't break up with Ece because she moved. When her father cheats on her mother... ...Ece was destroyed. Without me... ... she hates men... ...and he said I should go on without him. I also found a solution myself. And I decided to hang out with the girls for the day. I ate good shit. If I don't fall in love with anyone... ...When Ece gets over all this... ... I thought we'd start where we left off. How pathetic, right? But if he were here right now... ... I'm so ready to give up everything. Ece? OK, I'll be right back. See what you have. [spitting, gagging sounds] [moving music] Leaf. Leaf. [sniffs] Chocolate with liqueur. It was like this when I got home. But. Pray for the spare keys at my grandmother's. Next time there's this much noise You can be sure that I will inform the police. How are you? Can you walk to the room? A minute. I can handle my own business. All right, Ali Efendi? [vomiting sound] Tuna... Bedtime, little cheetah. Come on. I do not understand. How do you bet with that pole even if it means losing me? Because of that girl called Bade? Not a lost girl or a cocky guy. No one has the power to tear me away from you. But Bade is a very beautiful girl. Ali bird, do you think I'm beautiful? Five-year-old girl crying because she can't get a game in that gazebo it was very beautiful. I took it on my back because one foot was in a cast in middle school... ... and then the girl I dropped and broke her other leg. Today, the same girl is still very beautiful as she slowly slips out of my hands. Please don't change for anyone in the name of love. Is it possible? Leaf? I love you. [music] [joyful music] [laughs] Look son, I swear I'm going to dive into one now. Why are they laughing, son? Is my zipper open or something? You're so beautiful, dude, they're laughing at her. My dear Gökhan, I see that the interior and exterior washing has worked. Performance is top again. I'm going to ask you something bro. While washing the stomach, that hose Do they insert it from the top or... I don't know, Oğuz. If you want, let me consult a midwife working in the health sector, huh? The miracle of modern medicine. They took the dirt from his mouth along with the man's stomach, brother. That's it after that. To Merve, she will be your aunt again, I made some promises. I don't have such jealousy and abusiveness, brother. By the way, where is Leaf? The word good man could only sound so ugly. What happened to this? He turned into a fly that was sprayed with medicine. [Mary, breath] -Oho. -Good morning. -Good morning. Do I look so bad? No, no, honey, you look great. The only thing missing is... It's done now. I'll say something, dude, you wouldn't do such things. Well, the last time I ate chocolate, I don't remember what happened next. Dude, think about it this way, at least you're not drinking shampoo. Exactly. Ya da kankanla öpüşmüyorsun. Who did you kiss? Ali... you said? What happened? Are you angry? Do you know what to do? Let's kiss and make up. You love. Let's kiss and make up. Oooo. The double doves were also here. Actually, you're more than a dove... ...you look like gilded bamboo monkeys. Do you know the gilded bamboo monkeys? -Slow! -Excuse me, sir. I was trying to catch up. Here is another confused person who thinks he came to the shopping mall for school. Forgive my curiosity, young lady. How much shorter can a skirt get? If you're done with these fake fashion comments, would you let me? -I don't understand, lad. -I say, By detaining people right now, you are publicly hindering their teaching. As an educator, I hope you realize that this is unethical. Do you realize you're talking to a manager? Take back your words and apologize to me immediately. Of course, you likewise humiliate If you apologize to all these students, why not? That's enough! I'm going to call your parent today and get you suspended from school. I wouldn't recommend doing this. Because when my father heard about this outdated mobbing you did to your students, He can't wait to make a whopping lawsuit against you. [applause] These macaque flocks won't stay here! It won't stay here! Son, why are these laughing at me? -Yes, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. -Good morning teacher. Let's take our seats, clear the desks. Give your exam papers from front to back to your friends, please help. Yes, we cleared the desks, we will start when the paperwork is finished. Blow after blow. Ali bird, how will I get ninety? You keep that beautiful head of yours alone. No one has the power to tear me away from you. Yes, if it's over, let's start the paperwork exam. Tell me, Karademir. Teacher, in the garden of our school A Karademir principle is being violated by the eye. Let me go. You will be deemed to have scored zero on the exam. You know right? Sir, on the one hand, science, on the other hand, a lover dressed in tights and suspenders. Karademir is lost. [teacher clears throat] Here you go, master. Yes, the second blank paper of the exam came from Sinan Yorulmaz, right? What happened? Are you going to freshen up your makeup? are you in a hurry? [laughs] How so, sir, I do not understand? I hope you are not taken, I saw the photo you shared with the school group. No, I was not taken, I do not remember that I took a photo or something. -Shall I see? -Is that so? Ulan Oguz. - Shall I go out, sir? -Come on. I'll go out. [moving music] Leaf Ayvaz. Ninety-three. Yeah this nameless slobbering blank paper? Tekelioglu. -I couldn't sleep last night, sir. -I hope it was worth it. It was the best night of my life. Look at me, Tekelioglu. From now on it'll take me away from that dimple if you make any bets I do it so bad. [footsteps] Leaf, you were right what you said yesterday. I shouldn't have bet on losing you. So I made a big mistake. Al, al sana iddia. Get a loan! Ninety-three. Congratulations. In this case, you won the bet. -I'm sorry. - His apology is not from me... ... you will beg from Yaprak. I do not understand. You keep saying there is a princess in Yaprak... ... that's what you and people like you don't understand. Does she have to wear heels to be a princess? Isn't he worthy of anyone when he wears cloth shoes and swears? I don't care about your love. But what you did It does nothing but reduce Leaf's self-respect. That's why it's not my apology... ... you will beg from Yaprak. Leaf, Look, if my manners are hurting your self-confidence... ...I'm sorry. [moving music] Hoop, boom! Ali bird, hey! Ali bird oh my! Ali bird, hey! I think that cover sound was heard from the whole school. It echoed outside, that's all. Ali, next time you need to write my name on the exam paper. However, I forgive you. Or it adorns you too, I hand it over to Gökhan, who was imprisoned because of Merve. Gokkus, what happened? Mary left me. Come on. I was suffocating him with my envy. Let's go home, you can relax a bit. Dude, I think we should go too. I'm so stuck I swear I'm going to piss my bottom right now. All right. -Don't keep pulling. -Isn't he Bade? All right, come on girl, don't be hard on me. Hee Bade. If you come one. Is there any problem? No bro, as you can see we are talking to our girlfriend. Isn't it, darling? What lover? We are no longer lovers. What are you pushing? Look bro, obviously the girl doesn't have a heart. Don't stop doing artistic because there is a girl with you, don't be itchy. Go away! You walk too! -Are you okay? -I am good. We can take you home, do you want it? No, I'll go myself. Dude, I guess I can't hold it any longer, I'm going to pee. -Let's go home too. -Lets go. -Sevim sister, respect. -Mehmet brother. Ya Ali, is it still not cooked? We're hungry here. I don't understand how heavy this is. I don't speak up because my son is depressed. If I get there, I'll sweep you under the rug. Just kidding, this really tied him to the housewife. You're not human when you're hungry, bro. Dude, if you're too hungry, you can suck my toe from the front. That's it! There are no crossovers, you will watch the replay. I am coming. What are you feeding us today, Ali bird? I answer. With love and vitamins. Hmm. I adore vitamins. -Did you call Bade? -I don't have a number. It looked like he was going to get over it anyway. [painful cry] -What happened? -My eye. Leaf, are you okay, what happened? -Lemon, lemon. -Come on, let me see. -Open your eyes. -Stop, stop, it's burning. -Can you open your eyes, I'll see. -On fire! OK, open your eyes. Ooo. We are waiting for dinner inside, you... ... still lame. It's bad weather, I'll collect the laundry. No, the weather is fine. Let it be. I'll still collect. So... Of course I have to wash them first, right? He who took it lived. Leaf, bassana wedding. Our backs don't come down either. Joke and joke. The man has love. Is everyone miserable Sinan? He has. Then be like you Should we cry because \"Merve left me\"? There is room. -I gotta go. -Merve. Because my parents are on the way. If I'm not home when they come now big malfunction occurs. I'm going. # This girl loves me # # This girl kills me # # This girl makes me dream beautiful # I know, that kissing thing... ... yes, it was an accident, even Oguz and Sinan kissed... But while we laughed at them, we strangely chose to avoid each other. # This girl smiles when she sees me # # This girl # We hosted Tuna and her grandmother, whose houses were sprayed, for one night. The strange boy is that Tuna. Do not be afraid of anyone, but be afraid of an insect. And Peace. I never saw him again after his lost bet. Was I being too harsh on him? [cries of pain] The queen mother is in danger. Enough mother queen! Gone boy. It's warm, honey, it's cold. How was it? Is the skewer down a bit, let me see? Okay, it's down. He has proven once again how obtuse he is by coming here. Don't give me that \"why did I give birth\" look, queen mother. What is this rod doing here? How many times will I tell you my baby, my little Yaprak? We met at the market, I have bags in my hand. “Let me carry your bags, auntie,” he said. Move, baby, I said. Meanwhile, my neck was stiff. Ayy, how cute, how cute. Let me help my father throw the pole's body into the sea, and it's over. We are even. My dear, don't look at this crazy girl, your uncle Taner wouldn't do such things. Uncle Taner doesn't do such things. We already live in the Scandinavian country. Mistress, madam, your log is Manisa. My father's Amasya... ... I did not understand what the comfort of this is. Get out of there! I am a born and bred Izmirian. Anyways. Come on, my dear, you guys have a little chat, it's nice, let's see. I've thought a lot since the last time we met, Leaf. And I realized that I didn't give you the opportunity to get to know me. So I got stuck on this one, I'm sorry. Behind... ... let's start from scratch. No such mysterious gifts, games, claims. As Barış, I would like to invite you to the party tonight. Today we will gather at Ali's with the children. So have fun. Mom! You can go out, I'm going. To where? See you later. Or encountering the female of an MS life. Is this your joy? The female of your life? The teen whose love life is confined to the Kate Upton poster in her room says that? Even thinking about the details of that relationship makes my stomach turn up, bro. Gentlemen, am I sensing jealousy? Do not shake these, Oguz bird. I am already ready to be sister-in-law full of intrigues. That's it. My homie. Thank you. This was expected of you. -What do you mean I see? -Oh. The fun has begun. -Wow Wow wow. -Ali? -What's up? -Ece. -Gokhan? -It's the same brother, it's Merve. So Leaf, what are you doing? I'm fine Ali bird. Well, as you know. It's not like I know. We had peace just now. It's stuck with my mom. He was going to invite me to the party tonight. there is no claim anymore, I was going to give him a chance, something like that, that's it. Well, what did you say? I gave you your mouth's share, my dear, it's gone. Enough! We are a few teenage kids. What do you exaggerate so much about? I'm not saying don't exaggerate, exaggerate as a hobby. Take the food, for example. Don't let drinking out of trouble cause you to vomit. You missed the pizza too much... ... exaggerate the laughter. If you have tears in your eyes, let them come from laughter. I'm not exaggerating like Kanye West. Do not offend anyone with your jealousy. Neither the other person nor yourself. Don't be afraid. To make mistakes, to take chances, of sadness, of love, of rejection. We are young now. Aha. The master of my heart is coming. Leaf, be sober now. As soon as the message comes, you collapse on the table. Okey? Welcome. Are you hungry? Are you crazy? I could kill for a pizza right now. What about for four pizzas? Oghuz. Or Oguz. I hate to say this but... ...I think Oguz is right. We should be bursting with happiness, not anger. Exactly bro, maybe it's never too late to change. Pardon. I can't stand this ugliness any longer. -We are running away, the teenager is entrusted to you. -Thanks. I'm going to go make some room for these pizzas now. You wait here too. Gentlemen, the girl has come to a boil. Dirty time. Do not go! Don't go, don't go, don't go! [message notification sound] Leaf. Sometimes... ... to tell someone how you feel... -...you want a chance. -Understood. Ok, I get it, but... ... I don't know how I feel about Barış now. So I guess the only way I can understand that is if I go to that party. -Is that what you're trying to say? -Yeah. Well... I was trying to tell you that too. Good. Well... there are Oguz's. Both are not around. I'm here too. Look, you didn't get a message either. Come on, go get ready. -Come on. -Okay, okay, I'm going. I'm going. It would be better if you don't text the person you're going to mess with next time, my dear Oğuz. By the way... ...thank you very much for the beautiful photos. If you are very curious, you can see it on the school's website. [knife sound effect] # I spent my days watching my heart # # I tend to fall into the trap of the past # # Eliminate the heart # # Find me a new life now # # One or two nice words are enough to deceive # # Find me a new life now # # One or two nice words are enough to deceive # # A new life # # A new life # # Find a new life # # A new life # What are you doing here? -They said there is a party girl, we came. -It's Oguz. -Very nice. -I can't find anything to say. The fork doesn't look dull, does it? What is your score for me, Sinan bird? Perfect, ten of course. Wow, I thought there were no ten points other than Ece. There are now. We met again on the beach. But this time we managed to talk. And he gave me this note. Sinem, Gözde, Melis, Simay... so this list is getting long, what is it? When I said I don't want anyone else but you, he wrote a name on that list. If I give it enough chances... ... one day any of the people on this list... ... he will make me forget him. You see, there is no Ece anymore, baby. That makes you the only owner of ten points until the next lucky girl. I saw the photos on the school's page. I'm sorry that you weren't with Irem. Born? He did me a great disservice. That's why I declared her an MS first lady. So the girl who made me the mess of my life I guess you didn't think I'd miss it. By the way, he wished you a good time tonight. [clears throat] I also bought a gift that I thought would suit your outfit. -Did you buy me a present, my sky bird? -He stole it. Also the bag. -And a women's bag. -He sure stole it. Tamam lan tamam. Actually, I bought it for Merve... Since you bought it for Merve, my smart friend, give it to Merve. I saw him with someone else. Born? Leave one. I used to lead the funeral prayer for both of them there. ... I noticed something in Merve, brother. He was happy. I have never seen him this happy. So this bag is yours. You know, when you say something so lame and put it on your head, you understand? -AA. -I swear heavily, don't do it. Can not hurt you. -Where is Ali? -Phone is unreachable. Are you ready to burn the ground? Come on. Come on, help girl, help. -Thank you for everything, mom. -My dear. Thanks for letting me, dad. I'll be waiting at home by 12 at the latest, Yaprak. Off. TV shows my grandma watched... ... black humor remained next to your exaggerated drama. If you'll excuse me, I'm going upstairs to hang myself. Thank you too, Tuna. You thank the bugs that raided the house. It was the karma of your hospitality. Anyway, let's go now. They give you something like candy, chewing gum, let me say. Such a scumbag comes and talks to you, you say hello, where are you brother Gökhan? Gokhan brother, okay enough, you're offended by her daughter. Have fun, my dear. Guys, I love you all one by one, thank you very much. If you see Ali and reach him, tell him too... But. Will you extend it further? ...or should we turn into mice and the taxi into a pumpkin? You will definitely turn me into a potato from crying. Then... All our daughters, daughters for all of us. See you guys. What a night. What are we doing now? Well, I'll take İrem and pull off my pajamas... ... we will watch the sunrise together. [laughter] Born? What? Is it bad? Bad. You are breathtaking. [music] I love you. If you don't get off now... ... he doesn't look at your grace, I'll kick you out of the car. Come on. little titan... ... if you need it, I'm here for a message. [moving dance music] # Night falls, the sun does not rise on us # # Wake up # # It's not known if it's gone # # But maybe he'll come back if we do a dance # # Safe # # Don't go stay in my arms # # Safe # # Let's have a dance everything is ok # Leaf? Do we know each other? Excuse me, I'm Mert. I know you from our conversations with Barış. I am Barış's best friend. I also own this house and party. I understand you. Let me take you to the sulkiest man of the party. Come on follow me. Is it empty? Wow, I finally managed to get you to wear those heels. If you'll excuse me, I want to be a little proud of myself. If it takes too long, I'll go. You look charming, Amazon girl. This princess stuff is just not for me. My feet are really rotten. Born? As long as I can remember myself, my father has not been around me. He was either working or on a business trip. My mother took care of everything. It is because of him that I am here now. My mother was a true queen. It would surprise me that such a strong woman could be so elegant. Anyways... ... one day when I came home from school, I found a note in the hall. My mom on the note... ...he was saying that he was bored with my father's indifference and left the house. At that moment, I just... ... I was thinking how noble my mother's writing was. -Your mother? -He never came back. I also made a promise to myself. I was going to find my own princess. But unlike my father... ... I would never leave him alone. It saddened me to hear that Barış was a prince under the spell of the queen. Then you appeared before me. You were just like him. You took care of those around you. But you had one little thing. To look like a princess. Do you know? In fact, it doesn't matter what you wear or how you look anymore. You are the most beautiful thing that ever entered my life, Amazon girl. In, in, in. May I have this dance, please? Come on. [dance music] I love you. I love you. But? Peace, I... It's 12 o'clock, Cinderella. Are you curious about the rest of the tale? Then we go to the enchanted forest. [music] -Baris, why did we come here? -Shhh. Listen. Before everything know that doing this is the hardest thing in the world for me. Look Leaf... ... I can overcome any obstacle for you. But you have to get over the vines inside yourself first. If you still want me afterward, I'll be there for you. Peace... ... I'm sorry that I can't be a princess to ease your pain. No. You are a real princess. But... ... I'm not the prince in this fairy tale. To save the princess he loves... I am a selfless hunter who puts his own blood on his shawl. Go now. Maybe we'll meet again in another fairy tale, Amazon girl. [music] Peace. But? Do you love that much? Whenever a star falls... ... I'm using my wish so that that star passes in front of his window. Maybe I'm one of those who exaggerate, but I don't mind exaggerating. This place too... ...here too... ... this is hers. You are an enviable lover, Ali. I'm sure one day you will get the love you deserve. At least you have a chance to meet one day. I fell in love with an impossible person again and screwed everything up for myself. Tuna. It's so silly, isn't it? Bak Bade ... ... neither the Tuna thing nor your love is impossible. How so? Leaf told me. Tuna is nothing. So actually it's a secret, but... ... if it will save a heart from bondage... I am very sorry. Thing... ... for a moment I could not control myself. What will you do next? I will wait. until my last breath. Hoping one day those heels will tighten up. But this snow... Leaf? Leaf, what are you doing here? Why are you like this? calm down, okay? Everything is gonna be okay. Just tell me this. Did that guy do this to you? That guy is dead now. Don't go anywhere, I'm looking for the kids, I'll get you picked up. You did it. You did this to me, Ali. Because I handed you over to that guy myself? Approach. Leaf look, calm down, you will catch a cold. Put on that jacket. Do you think about me too much? Do you think too much of me? Then Ali, just be honest with me for once. Be honest! Behind... ... is your heart beating for him? Did you take me to Barış to meet Bade here? I saw you, he was kissing. Shall I be honest with you? My heart broke today when Barış told me that he loves me. I don't want to listen to this. You will listen! You will listen! My heart pounded because for a moment I wished it was you. But now I see that you don't even have the courage to say you love another girl. But as Barış brought me here today... ... he gave up his own love and pride and brought it. So, was he able to give up his childhood memories? -Or from tomorrow? -You're confusing me, don't do it. Love, pride. Shall I say the worst? Dreams with Leaf inside. Did he dare to give up on them? Neither Bade nor anyone else... ... I love you, Leaf. I've loved you since the day I found you crying twelve years ago right where you stood. I loved you every night, every morning, tirelessly. I am in love. Like crazy. I'm sorry but there is nothing else I can do! I love like dogs Leaf! Why did you do this? Why did you hurt yourself so much? I'm scared, little titan. I said no, I said no. I'm not afraid of losing my own life I was so afraid of losing you. I do not understand. I am hurting so much. Remember. When you were little, if you told me to be a cloud three times... ... I said that all your pain will pass. Be the cloud, be the cloud... ...become a cloud. Please pass. So are you sure you want me? The owner of this shoe I want. [music] What are you, a loser Cinderella who seeks help from fairies... ... nor am I a stupid prince looking for his love with a piece of shoe. Our story is different. [music] Then I'll collect the laundry. But first you need to wash them. [Leaf laughs] -Oh! -Down five. Ah! Bring your arm. It fit very well. So when are you going to stop beating me for falsehood? -Who? -Joyful. You nailed it with your ankle right. Let go now. Whenever I play with our children, I lose it. You make a difference whenever you play with them. But for some reason, when we play, I always win. They don't. Well, what should we do, I also win in love. I know this look. What went wrong little titan? No, there is nothing wrong. I am actually having the happiest time of my life. But now that we talked about children... ... do you think we should tell them? I thought about that too... ...but I have no idea where or how to say it. I mean, in case they say something, I... WTF? Let there be love. Ali, when were you planning to tell us? -Brother I... -Shhh. [clicks tongue] We are not blind, son. We loved it too, but... ... after some consultation with friends, we realized that... ... Ali bird is injured. Exactly. I wasn't going to do the talking, why are you interrupting? You're already talking, scarce. What was I saying? Ali is injured. You are injured, Ali. -It wasn't like that. -The other was better. We've reached the man who hurt you, Ali. And we brought it to your feet. Tuna! He himself. Tuna Karaman. You are stepping on the carpet. -Tuna Karaman, she's your lady Bade... -Don't step on the carpet, my son. Tuna Karaman, the guy who wrote to your wife Bade, brother. What about Oğuz, I'm going to drop the bomb, is it the turn of the carpet? Brother, drop your bomb before you step on the carpet. It takes your carpet, folds it, keeps the fold from its place... You are done! Do you know what the penalty is for detaining a person against his will? Not to mention the ill-treatment and torture. I was walking to Bade. I hope this intelligence will save you from being a ward tea seller. The love before your eyes... Shall we choke on a pizza? [laughs] # This girl loves me # # This girl kills me # # This girl makes me dream beautiful # # This girl grabs me and pulls me in # # I need a room, a bed, a library with this girl # # There was obviously a secret in her voice # # Every time I think of her in her white dress # # Trouble finds me and like sleep disappears # # This girl smiles when she sees me # # This girl loves me # # This girl kills me # # This girl makes me dream beautiful # # This girl makes me tell pretty lies # # This girl teaches me some new things # # Nightly # # I'm staggering to your door # # I know it's late but still don't blame me baby # # What does it mean to make love # # Whether we watch cartoons or go nowhere # # We better not see anyone, but we better not die of hunger # # There was obviously a secret in her voice # # Every time I think of her in her white dress # # Trouble finds me And as sleep fades # # This girl, this girl, this girl#\n"

      "\"Avici Hell is also known as Continuous Hell. Uninterrupted time, unlimited space. Boundless suffering for the fallen souls.\" UNINTERRUPTED TIME TIME I still remember my first arrest. It was December 12, 1980. My partner and I were patrolling Hanoi Road. We were notified that something bad was happening at New World Centre. We rushed over. There was a gang fight in progress. About 15 or so were already down. Lots of blood on the ground. Plus a severed hand, still holding a knife. My partner told me to draw my gun. I was a rookie so I did what he told me. But before I could open the holster, my partner had already collapsed. This kid stabbed his belly with a pipe. Blood gushed out of the sawed-off pipe. I didn't know what to think. I simply put all six of my bullets straight into that kid! I don't remember how many years he got. But when I saw him again two years ago, he was boozing in a club, looking sharp. His buddies were all Kwun's goons. Evil prevails. Only the good die young. Now I can barely recall my partner's face. I regret the six bullets weren't put into that kid's skull. The world shouldn't be like this. It's not the way to be, Sam. How long have you been there? Almost two years now. Do you know why I haven't arrested you? Because I'm handsome! Maybe so. Because I think you're a decent guy. I'd rather you control Tsim Sha Tsui. Forget about it. You couldn't kill the kid, even with six bullets. That makes you a decent guy. That's not the case. I don't want to be one. Kwun gave me everything, even my life. If I turned against him, I'd be beneath contempt, even in your eyes. Right? - I knew you'd say that. - That's a fact! Honor means little to the Ngai family. My master often says, \"Revenge knows its time.\" Who knows how you and I will end up? Time to work! This early? I've got to eat, so do my boys. Take the whole box. - That's okay. Keep it. - Don't worry about it! Just go! Enough. Hey! Want to use the back door? Ain't no rules against schmoozing with cops. The front door's fine. I'm used to it. Prat Avenue! Prat Avenue. HEUNGKONG OPERA CLUB Is Uncle Kwun in? Uncle Kwun! Someone's looking for you! Bye, Mary. They say this American antique's got sweet high, crisp middle and strong bass. Bullshit! One hundred and eighty grand! Who can afford it in Hong Kong? Sit. Only around 10,000 people can afford it. Sam asked you to be a mole in the force. If you don't want to, I can talk to him. You're my boy after all. It's fine. Sure? Positive. Hand me that bag. Mary. You look sulky these days. I thought you'd been dreading it. Hide in Tuen Mun until things quiet down. Stay fit for the Academy's new term. The money I'm giving you, spend it wisely. You like the song? Yeah. It's yours. It won't sound as good on another stereo. Someday, I'll pick out a good one for you. What? Don't like it? Not at all. - Sam gave you that watch, didn't he? - None of your business. Only you and I know about tonight. I don't want Sam to know. Why's that? Women are simple. If a man treats me well, I'll do anything. Now go home. I'm very busy tonight. No big deal. In the gangster world, it's either you or me who gets busted. The boss said I would see blood today. So what? My superiors think highly of me. They kept asking, \"Got a Mercedes today, Keung?\" I said, \"Of course.\" And here I am! Otherwise, I wouldn't be here with you. I would have Mainland girls in my arms, eating French toast. That's for sure! Hey, got a cigarette? I don't smoke. Let's forget about it. My car's fine. See? She says it's all good. It's fine. Look at you. All dressed up. Don't want any trouble, do you? Look at me. All beaten up by you. Who do you think the judge would believe? Think about it. I bet you guys never go to East Tsim Sha Tsui, huh? Know who I am? I'm Keung! Sam's top dog. Del Piero's boy. I'll kick your ass every time I see you. You can count on that. Hey. How about calling an ambulance, sir? Look at all the blood! Have them bring 500cc Type O blood. It's rare! Shut up! Wait until we're back to the OCTB. - Why do I have to go to the OCTB? - Get him. Hey, sir. I was only stealing a car. - What've I done to deserve the OCTB? - Just shut up! - Don't you know you're just a cadet? - Does that justify an OCTB beating? And you are expected to get an award. Don't let Yip know about this! Happy birthday, Yip! What's there to be happy about? Ten years in the Academy. A rustic hell. You managed to get me out. Your case is already ancient history. Ask the Commissioner to get you out. So what if the Commissioner's Chinese now? Still six more years until the handover. I'll be 48 by then! Might as well train a few good cops here. The world is yours after 1997. Hey. 27149! Cheers! Yan. It's been beeping. Why don't you call back? Girlfriend? - Cheers, sir! - Cheers! Leave me alone! It's none of my business! I don't want to know anything. Go! Hey! Law. What do you want? My father just passed way. He wanted his children to be informed when something bad happened to him. Sorry to have bothered you! Stop watching TV! Eat first, Blackie! I wonder what they have on Uncle Kwun's death. Did you do it? I've got a big mouth. Had I done it, you would've heard about it. Ask Kwok-wah and Gandhi. Darn it. When Kwun died, I was in Macao. Everybody knows! But I bet his kids think I did it. I ain't scared of anything. The eldest son's a doctor. The youngest, a brat. The daughter's married. Only the middle son's running the show. If they go too far, I'll show them. Sorry I failed to protect Uncle Kwun. That's enough, Uncle. Dad used to say, \"What goes around comes around.\" It came later than expected already. Kwok-wah, Man-ching, Blackie and Gandhi. Guess what those four are thinking. Thank you. Thank you all! How's Mom doing, Sis? She's fine. She's sleeping. She told me to bring some smokes to the morgue for Dad. I'll go get them. Hey. Team B, watch Tak Shing Street. Team C, watch the Austin Road exit of that financial building. It has two exits. One on Tak Shing Street, one on Austin... Hello? Something this big, why didn't you call? I called everybody the minute it happened! Kwun's boys can't sit still for sure. The trouble will start tonight. It's the 14th already. The 14th. Time to pay the Ngai family. I'm the youngest here, so let me be the troublemaker. Starting from this month, I'm not paying Kwun anymore. What do you three think? Cheers. - Cheers. - Stop talking nonsense. - Inspector Wong. - What's up? What're your men doing outside Kwok-wah's building? - It's not a good day for chit-chat. - Are you up to something? - Fine. Next time. Okay? - Hey. What's the occasion? Come on. Where's my seat? Only if you're here for the food. All other business has to wait. The food. It's all about the food. It's going to be a big night. Let the Big Four do their thing. We'll deal with the aftermath. Don't let them start fighting or you'll see bodies. What? Not happy? You know the rule. Pick a card to decide who takes command. Okay, highest card wins. Come on! There's nothing more for us to talk about. What's up, Hau? Kwok-wah. I heard you're planning a casino in Macao. I've got the government in my pocket. How about a joint venture? Uncle Kwun's dead. I'm not in the mood. I see. The Macao trip wasn't all business. I know you had fun with Gandhi's wife. Sorry, I can't drop my casino in Macao. I've got to go. What are Sam's people doing? I know Kwok-wah paid up. Don't change the subject. Tell me something I don't know! Call me when you get things straight! Hey, Hau took care of Kwok-wah in ten minutes. The Big Four are having a tough time. Hau took out a million's worth of coke. What? Mafia roadblock or what? Out of my way! - More people will come later. - Stop! I don't know why Kwok-wah paid up, Mr. Ngai. But I won't negotiate. I don't plan to negotiate, either. Pass the phone to Blackie. Hey, Blackie. Don't know why he calls you from my neighborhood. What's up, Hau? I'm with Gandhi all the way. He's not paying, so neither will I. I heard you and Gandhi have been tight. The heroin you two smuggled got stolen. You guys lost millions, right? Luckily, I found the stuff in your warehouse. Want me to hand it to Gandhi now? Hey, what's he talking about? From the Tsim Sha Tsui Big Five, Kwok-wah and Blackie paid up. Including Sam, that's three to two. I'm the youngest here. I've got to pay. See you. Don't think too much. Cheers! Hello? Pay my share for me! Inspector Wong, Mr. Ngai went to eat. A bit late for eating, don't you think? My dad always came here after work. I have to keep up the ritual. Do you want to join us? It's your seat from now on. Must be tough. Not at all. You guys worked all night for nothing. Now, that is tough. Well done, Hau. I hope you can keep it up. Don't let it turn into a tragedy. Let's go. What did you say? We want to celebrate Kwun's death. Time to pop the champagne! Want me to pop one for you? What? Want to mess with cops? Officers! The Ngais are in mourning. What more do you want? Let's go. Sam. Thank you. Dad used to operate street gambling here. It started out as a nickel-and-dime business. Now, who in Tsim Sha Tsui doesn't know his name? \"What goes around... comes around,\" he said. And now he's... I'll always remember this day. Hello? It's all good, honey. Want some snacks? Good to hear that. I'll wait for you at home. 27149. An officer has to have a clean background. Though you cut your ties with the Ngais many years ago, you still share the same father as Wing-hau Ngai. That means you lied on your application. I have to let you go. But before you leave, go see \"Mr. Wrong Socks.\" Still want to be a cop? Can I? Only if you can give me a good reason. I want to be a righteous person. If you want to be a cop, help me. You have no other way. You picked me because I'm Hau's brother, right? When the time comes, will you arrest him yourself? How do I start? Hey! Hey! Beat him up! Beat him up! - Get down. - How are the racing results? - Shut up. - Did you win? Did you? Shut up. You okay? Hang on in there? Hey, what's wrong? Does it still hurt? My dad passed away today. He was so good to me. I asked the officer if I could go to his funeral. The officer said, \"Know what it means to be a prisoner? It means you're not even allowed to attend your father's funeral. Don't you know that?\" - Get out of here! - Come on. Stop that. TIME Are you nuts? You sent Yan to be a mole? Don't you know Hau is his brother? So what? Bring me his file. So you're playing the boss now, huh? You know that the files are classified. I treat you like a brother, and this is what I get? If you're a real brother, don't ask. It's okay. Calm down. Speak carefully. She had an abortion! It's no big deal. Just a baby. You can always have another one! That's how it works. I've been with you for four years, and I've bailed you out a lot of times. One minute, we're dining with my folks, the next, you are in a gang fight. I don't want our baby to grow up like you. Do you understand? Why so uptight? It's nothing. Uncle says you're doing well. Ever thought about helping the family out? I know you want to keep a distance from the Ngais. But we're blood brothers. It's a fact. Right? It's my daughter's birthday this Sunday. You're invited back home. - You really hate talking to me, huh? - No. Promoted already? Soon you'll be a superintendent. Might as well become a full-time cop. Sam's kidding. Go on, give him a smile. Thanks for your intel these two years. When you were still a rookie, I helped you catch some small potatoes. It's about time you caught some big shots. How about catching me? Why so dirty? - Or you can catch this hot chick. - What're you doing? What a hot booty! Your man must be one good-looking bastard. It's you! Who else? - See you. - You're leaving? I've got to go meet Mr. Ngai. Sam's so good to you. But he's not good to himself. It's been four years. He could be in charge by now. But he's already given everything to the Ngais. Now the Ngai family is all powerful. Hau will take revenge for sure. For the past four years, I haven't been sleeping well. Hello? I'm Inspector Chi-shing Wong. Don't worry, Mary. I won't let anything happen to you. IO0746. Talk is cheap. IO0749. Get them upstairs. I promise. Wow! Hey. Hey. Up into the air! Two days ago, a real estate agent came. Guess how much he offered? 160 million! What's wrong with Hong Kong? Tell me! When my dad bought it, it was 9.28 million. - What a world. - Moving, Mr. Ngai? 1997 is approaching. Time to emigrate. It's no big deal. Communication's easy these days. - We're just a phone call away. - I'm just worried about the phone bill. The phone company's greedy, you know. I've discussed it with Mom. Our businesses is doing well. You guys have helped out for such a long time. I don't want to be ungrateful. I want to split the business up among you guys after I leave. Treat it as a gift or a retirement fund. Let's eat. Whatever you want. We should hang out like this more often. Mr. Ngai. Are you really leaving? After you're gone, all hell will break loose. You're a Buddhist, aren't you, Sam? Easy to start, hard to let go. I'm letting go, so be happy for me. I've thought about it. Cocaine is the future. Those four ship it in small bags from South America. Small-timers. I've closed a deal with the Thais. You'll have the monopoly. You'll be the top dog, the leader of the pack. Go to Thailand and wrap up the logistics. You plan to get rid of those four? Mom. Here, kiss her. Move closer to the right, please. Wing-yan! - Come join the family portrait. - Okay. Stand next to me! Okay. Let's take another photo. One, two, three. One more. I haven't been around much these two years. So this is a rare opportunity, spending time with the whole family. Your siblings are in legit businesses. It's time you helped out the family. Everything that Dad did was for the family. I have done the same. I hope you will, too. A deal's coming up next week. Come with me. I'll call you. APRIL 14 He's taking the deal seriously, so he'll do it himself. It'll take place next Wednesday. The 14th... Kwun's memorial. Hau wants to whack the Big Four. Why did he send Sam away? I don't know. Sam would be useful to him. Unless he wants to kill Sam too. Hey. I've been following you around. I'm your superior, after all. I want to know what your plan is. The Ngais are your family. Do you know what you're doing? Sir. I'm a cop. Good. Give me a salute. I've booked a table. Are you free for dinner? Look good in my cap? Keung. Looking good? What'll you do in Thailand in that outfit? Nothing special. Have some shark fin. A massage. Have a threesome. That's for sure. - Honey. - What? - Why didn't you tell me about your trip? - It's a business trip! Not for fun! Don't worry. I'll behave, okay? Hau plans to whack the four guys. I know. But do you know you're his target too? Nonsense! How can that be? Just wait for me at the airport. Time to board, Sam! HONG KONG KAI TAK AIRPORT That's all I can do for now. Call Sam again when the plane lands. I'm going to kill Hau tonight. Don't do anything rash. I'm not being rash. Four years ago, you told me to kill Kwun. So what? Want to blackmail me now? I'm not blackmailing you. We simply passed the point of no return! I'll send everybody away. Tonight's operation is top secret. We're divided into three teams. Team A watches here. Team B here. Wait for my order before doing anything. Team C follows the target until... Nobody told me about the date change. You know Hau changes his mind all the time. You think Yan's the only mole? My man has been undercover for seven years! Where are the cards? We'll run the show together tonight. Let's go! - Don't move. - Stand still! What is it, Hau? Keeping silent until your lawyer gets here? Come on, cooperate with us! In fact, I appreciate your cooperation. You're speaking so obscurely, Mr. Ngai. I don't get it. Dad used to say, \"The way things work in the streets, what goes around always comes around.\" He died four years ago. It's about time. The stove's hot enough now. She's here, boss. I'm out of here. You're here now. - What can you swing? - Wait and see. Got it, sir! The two foreigners are private eyes. Hello. Honey! - Where are you? - Thailand, of course. Come back right away. - Are you nuts? Why should I come back? - Don't ask questions! Just come back! Hau wants you dead! Nonsense! I'm working for him as we speak! Listen to me. I killed... Kwun. You've got a VCR? Is it good? It's an awesome show! Take care. Run if you have to. What did Hau say? - Sam. - Sunny! Four years ago, you told me to kill Kwun. - So what? Want to blackmail me now? - I'm not blackmailing you. We simply passed the point of no return! I'll send everybody away. I hired Alan and Johnson to investigate my father's murder. Who would've guessed? The police knowingly violated the law and killed my father, a law-abiding citizen. CIP Luk. Isn't that an officer in the video? Whether to nail him or not, that's up to you. What a good show. You're so damn photogenic. Four years ago, how much did Sam's woman pay you? Give me another chance, Mr. Ngai. I gave them a chance four years ago. They didn't take it. If I give you a chance... are you going to take it today? You've been with us for seven years now. You're a cop. We're the bad guys. Time to accept our fates. You can't blame me. Your Inspector Wong killed my dad. Any word from Sam? Sam called me, he said he was fine. He asked you to hide for a few more days and wait for him here. Where are your folks? All emigrated. You didn't want to go? Let's go, Sam! We got rid of the Thais. Let's go! You know you're not going to make it. I know. My girl's in danger in Hong Kong. - Please help me. - Why should I? Because I'll help you whack your boss. I know you want to be in charge. Moreover... I've been treating you as a friend. Don't believe him, Sam! Don't! - Get lost. - Don't believe him! Get lost! Sorry, Sam. Are you here to arrest me? If you're going to kill Hau, then I will arrest you. Then there's nothing to discuss. I spoke with my superiors. They're with you all the way this time. How's that? I conspired to murder! Even the Brits agree that we can't let the triads break us. Listen. The whole department's behind you. Good enough? Where are the cards? The highest card wins. Come back with me to the department. The key! Forget it. I screwed up. No need to drag everyone down. We found this on our first job. You've kept it, I knew that all along. Look. I've let you get your way in the past. It's your turn to listen for once. We're like brothers. I won't just stand by. Law's my snitch in the Ngai family. He hasn't contacted me for days. Neither has Yan. The key. Help! Help! Get some help! I need help. Why did you lie to me? I didn't. Something happened to Sam. I told you I was a simple woman. I have to do something for my husband. I'm going to Thailand. Please don't go! Forget it. You don't have to follow us anymore. I mean, I don't want you to go. You've been with Sam for years. Hasn't it occurred to you... that Sam's dead? What did you say? I can take care of you. - What are you doing? - I don't want you to go. You're out of line! Listen up. I'm your boss' woman. Don't let me see your face again. She will go to the airport tonight. Hello? Hello? I killed Kwun. If a man treats me well, I'll do anything. TIME File number IO3142. About Inspector Wong conspiring in murder. This is the 11th internal hearing, conducted by three senior officers. Inspector Wong, do you have any questions? No. No. On April 11, 1995, the department received this tape accusing you of conspiring in a murder with triad members. I plead guilty, sir. What happened to you? If I told you that the evidence couldn't stand, would you like to start over? I'm sorry. I broke the law. I'm grateful to all of you. But I no longer have any confidence. I lost. What about Luk then? Can you face him if you give up now? Wong, the war's not over. We all want a closure to this incident. The public needs to know Hong Kong isn't run by the Ngai family. Here's a file from Interpol. Read it before making your mind up. Ever been to a funeral in Thailand? A few months ago, I had one for my wife. The monks chanted for three full days. I didn't shed a single tear. On the day of the burial, they left the casket in the living room. I was mad. I wanted to beat them up. The monk told me it's a tradition in Thailand. The deceased... as long as we keep her company for a little while, can attain eternal peace. But I asked the monk, \"What if my wife wasn't in the coffin, could she still attain eternal peace?\" Sorry about your wife. The monk placed his hand here. He said, \"No problem. Your wife's here.\" And this is exactly... where the Thai guy shot me. So I told myself... I've passed the point of no return. Testifying against Hau in Hong Kong could be dangerous. I believe in you. You're so handsome. Haven't heard that for ages. Thanks. What's your plan? Just trying to do my best. No big deal. Just doing my job. I'll leave Hong Kong when it's all over. See you later. You've changed! You cut something into the coke. Got anything to say? Take it all then. Don't go too far, Yan. It'd break the boys' morale. Mr. Ngai asked me to do this. Don't like it? Drive him to a hospital. No matter what, they're elders after all. You've got lots to learn from them. Uncle will retire in a few years. You know what I mean? I don't need any hiccups now. The Labor Athletic Association has a dinner party... for us Political Consultative candidates. If everything works out, our family will no longer live in shadows. CELEBRATING THE HANDOVER Mr. Zhang. Mr. Ngai. - This is Mr. Zhang. - How are you? When Solicitor Hung mentioned you, I didn't believe him. You're amazingly young, Mr. Ngai. - What's your Zodiac sign? - Ox. The Year of the Ox. Ox is good. Director Chen likes young people. - I'll introduce you later. - Thanks. Really? Director said he hated the triads. That's right, SP Leung. Mr. Ngai's been invited to act as a consultant to the police. Really? Congratulations. - Where do you golf these days? - Zhongshan. Zhongshan? What's your handicap these days? - Hello. - Mr. Kwok. Mr. Wing-hau Ngai. I'm Mr. Ngai's solicitor. Tonight's a celebration for Hong Kong's handover. All other business can wait. What if I say no? Got any problem with that? Mr. Ngai, you're a suspect in several murder cases from 1995. This is your arrest warrant. You're under arrest. Everything you say will be recorded and could be used as evidence against you. Do you have any questions? No. I looked through their files. The murder charges won't stand. But the charge of being a triad boss, that one will stick. Brother, the unions and the political parties called. They want to withdraw their invitations. News from the HK and Macao Affairs Office. They have revoked your candidacy. - Call Beijing. Get some friends to help. - Let me try. Forget it. They even found a dead man to testify against you. Everyone knows how loyal Sam was to you. Now he's the prosecution's witness It's over. Sorry. Can't help you. You said there'd be no problem. Everyone's watching to see how we react. What are you going to do? What can I do? Threaten the government? Don't take it the wrong way. We're all in the same boat. I should be off then. I'm just a lawyer, not one of you. I don't intend to sink with you. Yes. Sam has a wife and a daughter in Thailand. It's your call. Sis. You and the brothers should take Mom to Hawaii for a while. Okay. Okay. Haven't been there for a while. - Are you going to be all right? - I'll be fine. Sorry, I can't help the family. - The key thing is you turn out okay. - Don't be silly. We're a family. Take care of Mom. Don't worry. Leave it to us three. Even with my testimony, Hau will only get a couple of years. It's true. He'll have to whack you to get life. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I have to thank you. Without you, I could never have come back. Save it! I'm busy these days. Anything you need, ask them. They'll protect you. Okay. Sam. Thanks. So, how's it going? Good. I've been transferred to the CIB. I will be Inspector in Training next month. Did Mary call you... before she left? Don't be too hard on yourself, Sam. Inspector Wong said to ask you if I needed anything. Will you really help me? {\\an8}KAI-CHEUNG LUK KAI-YIN LAW I thought you wouldn't come. Why's that? So here we are. It's been two years. Because of my father's case, you didn't dare to call me for two years? You couldn't face me? Right. Everything you need to nail Hau is in the safe. I've organized the files by date. Why do you still help me? I'm not helping you. I'm a cop. I want to keep my promise to SP Luk. I don't want to work undercover anymore. Two more years and I'll become the top dog. What for? To end up in prison? Let's bury the past. Just close the case and bring me back into the department. Give me a nice desk. Make sure it has a sea view. And don't let me see your face again. Don't worry, you won't see me anymore. One more thing. I couldn't spell some of the words. Come find me if you don't understand. But don't mess up the order. I worked so hard on that. I'll kill you if you do. That's great. Then I'll owe you nothing. You wish. Thank you, officer. Sam, we've gathered enough info. The trial will start in three days. Mr. Hon. Hello? OCTB. Inspector Wong. Sam's gone. He escaped through the kitchen. Who was guarding the kitchen? Sam made a call to Thailand before he escaped. Hello? Mr. Ngai. What do you want from me? You called me, so tell me how you can help me. Am I right? Sit down. Whack me. Kill me and it's all over. Why should I? I haven't done that kind of stuff for ages. Everything can be negotiated. Hong Kong's big enough for us both. We could even be partners, Sam. Let's forget about the past. You will kill me. You'll kill me tonight But who's going to take care of your family? Just in! Hau has Sam's wife and daughter as hostages. That's his Thai maid. I managed to stay alive all these years. It's all because... I have some good buddies in Thailand. You'll want to take this call. It's from Hawaii. Your whole family's there. My Thai buddies, too. Where's Daddy? Where is he? Mr. Ngai! Shut up. You'll whack me tonight. I told you so. - Police. Freeze! - Get down. Quick! Get down. Freeze! Put it down, Wing-hau Ngai! Don't stop him! He tried to kill me once before. Let him try again! Officers! After he shoots me... it'll be your call to shoot him or not! What goes around... comes around. Two questions. Did you kill his whole family? Of course not. My buddies and I were just scaring him. Did you expect me to kill him? Would you believe me if I said no? I expected to die here. It was my only option. Sorry. Do you know how hard I worked to collect tons of evidence to put him away for life? Who is this? Hello. The Thai guy, Sam. Paul! Thank you. It's all good. We're partners now. Cocaine will go straight to Hong Kong. Should I wrap up the Ngai episode? Paul... maybe we shouldn't go too far. It was pure luck that you bumped into me. Otherwise you would've been killed. We were destined to be partners when my gun failed to kill you. We have to go this far. The handover ceremony of Hong Kong commenced earlier at 11:20. Both countries' anthems were played by the military bands. A British flag rose up in the hall. The ceremony was dignified. Yet it had its share of relaxed moments before its commencement. When both countries' military bands played, {\\an8}some Chinese representatives took pictures. {\\an8}Prince Charles and Governor Patten were smiling as they entered the venue. The ceremony officially commenced. Three British soldiers and three Chinese soldiers, who were holding the PRC flag, marched slowly onto the podium. The Chinese soldiers displayed the PRC flag. Following their lead, three HK Royal Police officers emerged with three HKSAR Police officers, who were holding the HKSAR flag. The three SAR officers displayed the HKSAR flag to the honorable guests. And now all the guests have risen. It was exactly midnight, the arrival of July 1, 1997. The PRC flag rose with the HKSAR flag, marking the end of the colonial era. It also signified the beginning of the One Country, Two Systems policy. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China has been established. Okay, it's a deal. Come join me. You know what the worst kind of boss is? An ugly boss. Looks are everything! Look how I shine. What's your name, miss? What's your name, miss? I'm... Ma... I'm Ma... Mary. Mary. I'm... \"Continuous Hell embodies 3 components: Uninterrupted time, unlimited Space, Boundless Suffering. Transgressors of the deadly sins fall into this hell forever, Condemned to the ultimate incessant suffering.\"\n"
