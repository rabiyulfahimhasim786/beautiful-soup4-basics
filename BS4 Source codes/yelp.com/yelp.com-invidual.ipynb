She was always very thorough.  I really liked that the office was located close to my job and home. Her beside manner was great and every year I had my physical she took the time to go over my results with me and tell me what I needed to be in the best health,  she was great. I loved her phlebotomist. She was so nice and great bedside manner as well. So at about October 2020 I was reaching out to her getting some information because I was getting ready to have surgery.   Everything was good until I needed the office to fill out paper work regarding my COVID results and yearly physical.  I was charged $25 for the office complete the forms for medical leave.  Her staff took their time completing the documents  as well as incorrectly putting in the information.  When I call to question their slow response to my request, the staff was rude, curt and very short with me. I informed Dr. Hayley of her staff&apos;s behavior during my next doctor visit. She acknowledged she would address the issue with her staff. So fast forward to the year 2021 didn&apos;t really have any medical issues just needed to do my yearly exam .. call to have that done she had no available dates for the rest of the year. Called her back in January they didn&apos;t have anything until the end of February.   I inquired with the person who answered the phone at the time what is the process if I need to get medical files transferred to another doctor just in case I needed to get a new general practitioner.  At the time every one was booked about the same as her.  So I called today to attempt to get an appointment and her staff told me they could not schedule me because I inquired  about transferring my files. I ask to speak with the doctor directly,  they replied they could give me the office manager.  I asked again to have the doctor contact me directly and they said I could leave a message but it would most likely be the office manager contacting me because Dr. Hayley does not speak directly with patients.  I know a message will not be left with her therefore I am writing this review.  \\n\\nI am more upset with her staff than the doctor.  But the problem I have with this whole experience is this... Doctors are responsible for the staff they have around them. Especially because  your staff is the  first contact with your patients.  I know it has been a long two years,  but I am sure it will be longer if she has no patients.  I believe you should have phenomenal gate keepers when working in the medical field.  There are many doctors who your patients can choose. My next step will be to file a claim with the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners. \\n\\nDr. Hayley, I wish your staff was more efficient, effective, caring, and understanding.  I wish you all the best in the future.\"\n",

Basically, since I moved here when I was wee.  Living in the med center, and Pearland, driving back and forth to Tomball to see my doctor was a bit much.  A friend of mine is a patient of Dr. Nguyen&apos;s, and referred me when I was searching for a new PCP.  I called, and received my first appointment in less than two weeks, which in my experience is ridiculously quick as a new patient.  Since that time, they have gotten me in on same day appointments consistently when the need arises.  It&apos;s quite fantastic.  \\n\\nDr. Nguyen&apos;s office is conveniently located close to the Heights.  It&apos;s nowhere near Pearland, but a quick ride from work, which is where I spend most of my awake hours.  They have complimentary valet, though I never use it.  I purchased a car so I could drive, not for others to do so.  Nice fellas though.  In all of my appointments, I never waited longer than 5 minutes for a scheduled appointments, or 15 minutes on a stand by for acute issues.  The front desk staff, intake nurses, and the young ladies that take 7 vials of my life force every time I come through, are all very courteous, professional and welcoming.  \\n\\nThe clinic has very clean and bright rooms.  When you first walked in, the nurse discusses your entire medical history, or any changes to it on subsequent visits.  Taking detailed notes.  This isn&apos;t always the case in my experience, so it is much appreciated.  When Dr. Nguyen rolled in after, she recited everything I had discussed with the nurse damn near word for word.  That made me happy.  Their internal communication is on point, and quite detailed.  In other places, it&apos;s a cursory question repeated by every provider seen.  This was a welcome change for me.  Dr. Nguyen spent a good 30 to 45 minutes reviewing my medical history, and medications before my exam.  There was no rushing to get through and move on to the next.  It was a very relaxed visit.  She took her time, answered everything and gained a very satisfied patient. She&apos;s extremely knowledgeable, and very approachable. \\n\\nI definitely recommend her, and have done so for friends in the market for a PCP since I first saw her in 2014.  Healthcare done right.  Make a good decision today, and get an appointment with Dr. Nguyen.\"\n",

So being the person I am, I had to go see the hype. Three years later, Dr. Nguyen&apos;s is my tried and true PCP whom I recommend to all my friends and family. Being from SW Houston, I get a lot of &quot;why the hell do you drive that far out to see a Dr.&quot; but they don&apos;t understand the importance of having a Dr. you truly trust and actually enjoy visiting. \\n\\nDr. Nguyen&apos;s always been great about examining me for whatever ailment is bothering me that day. Appointment availability has been good to me, testing results are prompt, communication is excellent, prescriptions always sent timely. I love her online portal which allows me access to all my health docs. Dr. Nguyen feels like the cool older sister who is looking out for my best interests and is not gonna be weird or judgy when I tell her things. I&apos;ve worked with PCPs who are in and out of that exam room as though they&apos;re timing their laps, but I never feel that way with Dr. Nguyen. She&apos;s super sweet, excellent professional manners, and very attentive. I always feel like I&apos;m getting excellent care from her, and I appreciate that her exams are like actual conversations as opposed to detached checklisting and charting.\\n\\nSpeaking of charting, either her charting is super detailed or she has excellent memory bc she speaks to me during annual checkups like she just saw me last week. She seems to make an effort to get to know her patients, which I really appreciate. \\n\\nOverall, really enjoy having her as my PCP. She seems to be getting super popular, so if you&apos;re still able to secure her as a Dr before she is unable to accept new patients, I&apos;d do it NOW! Highly recommend!\"\n",

I knew at my first visit that she was the one. Dr. Nguyen is extremely caring and really focuses on getting you well fast. I&apos;ve never had an issue making same-day appointments, and she has a knack for diagnosing quickly (and accurately).\\n\\nDuring my first visit, I thought I was having a stroke or something. Turned out I just had a bad muscle strain in my chest (and a bad case of overreacting lol). She hooked me up with some meds that helped heal the strain and keep me comfortable. The particular medication she prescribed super cheap for a high quantity and delivered straight to my house.\\n\\nMy second visit was due to a cold virus and creeping sinus infection. She prescribed me a slurry of meds, plus gave me a B12 shot and steroid shot. I&apos;ve come down with the same illnesses before... almost chronically. I&apos;ve *never* healed up so fast. Normally I&apos;m sick for a whole week or more. This is day two and I&apos;m already feeling much better.\\n\\nDr. Nguyen is a godsend. She makes sure to limit the number of general check-up appointments to make room for sick appointments. She goes above and beyond to get you the right medicines at the right costs. She&apos;s just so considerate. I live in Sugar Land and have no problem driving 30 minutes to the Heights to see her.\"\n",

I turned to yelp and read numerous glowing reviews of Dr. Nguyen. Hoping for the best, but expecting maybe less (seriously, how great can a doctor&apos;s office be?), I called up and arranged an appointment.\\n\\nWith my initial visit appointment set for Monday at 9am I set off for her office. Walking into a waiting room with about 6 patients waiting at 8:45 led me to believe I&apos;d be waiting a while. Since this had been par for the course at my previous doctor I wasn&apos;t particularly upset by it. I&apos;m accustomed to having to wait about 15 minutes past my appointment time so I figured if they beat that I&apos;d be ok with it.\\n\\nImagine my surprise when, at 8:58, they called my name and took me to the back to start my appointment. Looking good already!\\n\\nThe nurse took me to a small side room and did the usual weight and blood pressure thing and then took me to the exam room. Within 5 minutes the doctor walked into the room. Dr. Nguyen was pleasant, attentive, and very efficient. She conducted my annual physical exam and answered all of my questions thoroughly. Once she was certain I had no further questions, and fully understood everything she had discussed with me, she took me to the in-house phlebotomist to extract a portion of my life fluid. No waiting. No fuss.\\n\\nThe entire time I was in the office I never felt rushed. This wasn&apos;t a normal experience for me since I had always felt hurried at my previous doc. I understood afterward why this was. As I was walking out of the office to my car, I glanced at my watch to see it was only 9:35. Efficiency makes all the difference. What normally would have taken an hour or more only took 35 minutes. Even better, I had scheduled my workday to begin at 11am expecting to not be done with my exam until at least 10:30. Plenty of time to pick up coffee:)\\n\\nI went in expecting average. I left impressed, with enough time to unwind before work, on a Monday morning. Good stuff!\"\n",

I&apos;d called ahead to make my appointment and to provide my insurance information as it had changed. When I went in for my appointment, I checked in with front office staff with no issue. It was only after I had gone back to see Dr. Nguyen, in the middle of my visit, where I was notified that she does not accept my insurance plan. I was then asked how I planned on paying for the visit. \\n\\nLuckily, I had an HSA and was able to pay for the cost of the visit with no issues. But I was upset that even after providing my insurance information, it was not verified until after my appointment. The visit was  a waste of time and money as I did not even get my levels checked (one of the main points of the visit) as I did not want to incur any additional fees for this visit. \\n\\nI will not be back but I want to warn current and potential patients to please make sure they check your insurance information prior to your visit or you may be faced with an unexpected bill.\"\n",
